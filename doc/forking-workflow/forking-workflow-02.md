The following is a step-for-step walkthrough of the workflow - part 01.

Atlassian Git Tutorial: [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
GitHub Docs: [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Used Example Repos:
https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/example-central-repo
[drblinken/example-central-repo-fork](https://github.com/drblinken/example-central-repo-fork)

### 1. Make some local changes
(Note that I made a mistake here: I should have created a branch first, e.g. with `git checkout -b b0_pr1_create_project`)

### 2. git push
The changes are now visible on github:
![](./forking-workflow-02/image_2.png)

### 3. create PR
https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/example-central-repo/pull/1
the commits are listed in the PR:
![](./forking-workflow-02/image_3.png)

### 4. make 2 fixes..
of course, the SGS requested changes. So, 2 more commits are added:
![](./forking-workflow-02/image_4.png)
### 5. push them - they will be visible in the PR!
![](./forking-workflow-02/image_5.png)
### 6. PR is MERGED
success! This is how the central repo looks like:
(I made the second mistake here - I did a merge instead of a squash & merge which would have replaced the 5 commits in the PR into a single clean commit. This would have been preferable because the 5 commits clutter up the history and usually are of no use for others):

### 7. Get the PR to your local repo (clone)

The local repo still looks the same:
![](./forking-workflow-02/image_7.png)

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:htw-imi-showtime/example-central-repo.git
git fetch upstream main
```

![](./forking-workflow-02/image_8.png)
Now, upstream/main is in your local repo. If you continued working on main now (commit 0f64ac3) youâ€™d still work from your old history, withouth the PR merge commit df588e5 in your history.

### 8. PR 02: A better way

As mentioned, with PR 01 I made two mistakes:

1. not creating a branch locally
2. Merge instead of Squash & Merge in the Central Repo

With PR 2, the local changes are in their own branch `pr_02`
and the pull request was squashed into a single commit, 
(6b9ce04) (apart from possible other changes in the main repo,
they should be the same, and contain all your changes made in branch pr_02)

This is what the local repo looks like after getting the pr commit from upstream:

![](./forking-workflow-02/image_14.png)

There will never be a merge. The branch pr_02 can be deleted, or 
kept for reference if you like to keep your detailed history.

### 9. Prepare a branch for further work

There are several ways to resolve this - see the next page.
