# Showtime Website - Showtime Preparation Workflow

The workflow we use is called "Forking Workflow". It is quite common for open source projects to contribute changes
to a source code base you do not have direct write privileges to. (like the central showtime-website repo).

- enough knowledge of git is assumed. You will also want an alias for git log where you can see the branch structure, see [git-log.md](./git-log.md)
- [forking-workflow-01.md](./forking-workflow-01.md): a tl;dr; and why 
- [forking-workflow-02.md](./forking-workflow-02.md): create branches and Pull Requests
