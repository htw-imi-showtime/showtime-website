            UX-UI Design
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        In the initial stages of development, one key challenge our team faced was <strong>designing a user interface</strong> (UI) that effectively
accommodates the input of constraints and preferences from teachers. None of us is a professional UX-UI designer, therefore, creating
an appealing and simple UI for admin or teachers to specify their requirements posed a significant hurdle, as it required striking
a balance between complexity and user-friendliness. We undertook several brainstorming sessions ensuring that the UI could be used efficiently
without overwhelming the user.

            Data migration &amp; data structure
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        One of the first problem in our development journey revolved around efficiently <strong>reading and importing</strong> the data stored
in Excel files into our database. Handling data migration from Excel to a database format presented a unique set of challenges.
Throughout the project implementation, further key challenges included establishing effective storage solutions within our database,
<strong>defining data structures and relations</strong>, and ensuring the data integrity and consistency. Addressing these hurdles was essential
for a successful project outcome, and the devised solutions significantly enhanced the effectiveness of our data migration process.

            Solving library
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>In our student project, the main challenge lay in developing a time planning system capable of generating a schedule
that meets all our constraints. Our search for an open-source solution led us to <strong>Timefold</strong>, a promising library for
automated schedule generation. However, integrating <em>Timefold</em> into our project posed its own set of challenges,
such as aligning our data structure and code implementation with <em>Timefold</em>&rsquo;s functionality. The adaptation process
required in-depth comprehension of <em>Timefold</em> itself. The library proved to be transformative, becoming the backbone of our project.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenting with different solver configurations and approaches</strong> to solve the planning issue also consumed
a considerable amount of time. We tried numerous configurations in an effort to optimize the system, but these
attempts were time-consuming and often did not yield the expected improvements in schedule optimization. In overcoming
these challenges, we not only technically integrated <em>Timefold</em> but also elevated the efficiency and effectiveness of our
time planning system.</p>

    <h3>
        
            Implementing constraints
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <strong>Implementing defined constraints</strong> was a notable challenge during the development phase.
The specified constraints were initially documented in a human-readable manner, and then our focus shifted to
transforming them into a format compatible with <em>Timefold</em> for scoring solutions. <em>Timefold</em> operates with constraints
structured in a stream-like fashion, introducing an additional layer of complexity to the translation process.
The successful implementation of the constraints allows us to generate a schedule that meets all the predefined
constraints and to ensure the feasibility of the planning.

    <h3>
        
            Security
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        Security was also a priority in our project, especially because we dealt with sensitive personal information.
To safeguard the stored data in MongoDB and prevent any potential data leaks, we implemented an approach involving
the utilization of Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) and Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) for data encryption
and decryption. The task became even more complex when we added the Login feature, which required the
implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure authentication and configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) to allow only known sources and block unauthorized attempts. One of the most challenging parts was <strong>integrating
everything smoothly with Spring Boot</strong> while adhering to its guidelines and conventions. Despite these challenges,
our team successfully addressed these complexities, including the seamless integration of JWT for login authentication
and ensuring that the data is stored in an anonymized format, establishing a secure foundation for the project&rsquo;s
functionality. This dedication to data security ensures a safe and confidential environment for the users of our platform.
