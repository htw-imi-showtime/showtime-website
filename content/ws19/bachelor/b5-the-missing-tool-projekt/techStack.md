### Node.js & Socket.io

We made use of Node.js, which is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime and designed to build scalable network applications. Together with Socket.io, which enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication, we had the perfect base for building our application.

### MongoDB

We decided to work with MongoDb, which is a document-oriented database system, classified as a NoSQL database program. It is really simple to use, but offers deep query-abilities at the same time.

### Docker

Our application runs on a virtual machine within a Docker container. Because containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries and configurations, they are a perfect base for applications that are run on different machines.

### Testing & Continuous Integration

We thoroughly tested our application with Cypress.io, which is a fast and actually really fun testing tool, because you can see the tests being run in your browser! We integrated Cypress in our Continuous Integration pipeline that was run by Travis CI on Github.

### Communication & Sprint Planning

We used a form of SCRUM to organize our project work and therefore used Jira for the sprint plannings. Our communication happened via Slack & Discord. Apart from that we probably used all common tools like GoogleDocs and friends.


We are nearly at the end. But what's next? Read about the things we planned for the future:
