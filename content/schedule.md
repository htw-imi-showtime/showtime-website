There will be brief project presentations with a quick Q&A in the morning (very brief presentations, the odd times are real, we might even be a bit quicker than this) and
  a project fair in the afternoon, both a <a href="https://htw-berlin.zoom.us/j/97320821203">Zoom Session with various breakout rooms.</a>\
  Please install the <a href="https://zoom.us/download">Zoom client</a> to be able to move freely between breakout rooms.
  Additionally, we have a <a href="https://discord.gg/RxBsnMqHyX">discord server</a> for announcements, discussions and a general overview independent of the Zoom rooms.
  It is already open and will be available after the event.
