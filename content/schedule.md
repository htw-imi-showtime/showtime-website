There will be brief project presentations with a quick q&a in the morning* and
  a project fair in the afternoon. Everything takes place in <a href="https://htw-berlin.zoom.us/j/97320821203">Zoom</a>.\
  There will be Breakout Rooms for the project booths and other things in the afternoon.
  Please install the <a href="https://zoom.us/download">zoom client</a> to be able to move freely between breakout rooms.
  * (*very brief presentations, the odd times are real, we might even be a bit quicker than that)
