There will be brief project presentations with a quick Q&A in the morning (very brief presentations, the odd times are real, we might even be a bit quicker than this) and
a project fair in the afternoon, both a [Zoom Session with various breakout rooms](https://htw-berlin.zoom.us/j/97780958236).\
Please install the *latest* [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) to be able to move freely between breakout rooms.
If you are unsure how to do this, this [guide](/zoom-help) may help you.
# Additionally, we have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/RxBsnMqHyX) for announcements, discussions and a general overview independent of the Zoom rooms.
# It is already open and will be available after the event.
