{{<section title="Terminology">}}
Even though we've spent a lot of time working with extended reality, we sometimes find ourselves questioning the precise terms used in this field. So, we thought it couldn't be different for you and decided to create a brief guide to some of the most frequently used terms in the world of XR:
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Virtual Reality (VR)">}}
**Virtual Reality** is a fully immersive digital environment where the user is completely surrounded by a computer-generated world. Using VR headsets and sometimes hand controllers, users can interact with this virtual space as if they were physically present.

{{<section title="Augmented Reality (AR)">}}
**Augmented Reality** overlays digital information on the real world. Unlike VR, AR does not create a fully immersive virtual world. Instead, it adds to the user's real-world view, often through smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses, by displaying images, text, or other digital elements.

{{<section title="Mixed Reality (MR)">}}
**Mixed Reality** blends elements of both AR and VR, where real and virtual worlds interact. MR technology anchors virtual objects to the real world, allowing for more complex interactions between physical and digital objects and environments. MR typically requires more advanced hardware like AR glasses with additional sensors to understand and interact with the physical environment.

{{<section title="Extended Reality (XR)">}}
**Extended Reality** is an umbrella term that includes Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. This broad category covers all types of environments and interactions where the real and virtual worlds converge, created through computer technology and wearable devices. XR represents the entire range of immersive technology experiences.
