{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
In recent years, the technology landscape has seen the emergence of various terms like XR, AR, and VR, all centered around a common concept: expanding and enhancing our perception of the world with **virtual or mixed reality applications**. While numerous XR games have already flooded the market, there has been a notable gap in offerings for **shared experiences**.

Enter **Somethin.AR**, our visionary project born out of the desire to create an immersive, shared virtual experience where the boundaries between the digital and the real world dissolve seamlessly. Our mission was clear: to enable people to spend quality time with their friends while exploring this immersive fusion of reality and virtuality. To make that happen, we put on our **Meta Quest 3 headsets** and pushed the boundaries of the ever-changing technology.

{{<section title="The team">}}
All of us worked together to provide the best shared experience we could, utilizing our power as a team to tackle this challenge from different perspectives.

When we began this project, our team members had different levels of experience. **Ruslan** and **Robin** took charge of colocation, making multiplayer mode possible in our game. They dedicated their efforts to researching and testing methods for sharing room mesh data over the network with other players. **Juri** handled the implementation of enemy logic using AI and managed the game state, ensuring a seamless gaming experience. **Diro** was responsible for improving the game's overall look and feel, smoothly integrating the virtual and real worlds. Meanwhile, for **Julia**, it marked her first venture into game development. She focused on designing UI elements and interactions in VR with the Meta Quest headsets and also assumed a crucial role in project management, overseeing the organization of the project as well as the showtime.
