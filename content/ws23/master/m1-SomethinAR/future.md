{{<section title="Further Potential of our Game" >}}
During the initial stages of our game development, we brainstormed numerous ideas that, due to time constraints, couldn't be realized in the current version. This section highlights some of these concepts to showcase the **underlying potential and future directions** our game could take.

{{<section title="Collecting upgrades and special skills" >}}
One idea we have is to introduce a system where players can **collect upgrades and special skills** throughout the game. This would add an extra layer of strategy and customization, allowing players add more variation to their gameplay.

{{<section title="Wider range of weapons" >}}
We're looking to expand our range of in-game equipment, adding **different types** of weapons for players to use. This will bring more variety to the game. Additionally, players will have the option to take these weapons from each other, creating a strategic element where they can **hinder the opposing team's ability to score points.**

{{<section title="More interactable objects" >}}
Another idea is to **increase the number of interactable objects** within the game world. These objects would provide more opportunities for interaction and exploration, enriching the game's environment and player engagement.

{{<section title="Placing virtual walls to promote movement" >}}
We're also thinking about incorporating virtual walls in the game's design. These walls would **encourage players to move around more**, adding a physical aspect to the gameplay and making it more dynamic and immersive.
