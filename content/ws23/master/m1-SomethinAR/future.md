{{<section title="Further Potential of our Game" >}}
During the initial stages of our game development, we brainstormed numerous ideas that, due to the fact that we spent a lot of time working on the colocation, couldn't be realized in the current version. This section highlights some of these concepts to showcase the **underlying potential and future directions** our game could take.

{{<section title="Collecting upgrades and special skills" >}}
One idea we have is to introduce a system where players can **collect upgrades and special skills** throughout the game. This would add an extra layer of strategy and customization, allowing players to add more variation to their gameplay.

{{<section title="Wider range of weapons" >}}
We're looking to expand our range of in-game equipment by adding **different types** of weapons for players to use. This will bring more variety to the game. Additionally, players will have the option to take these weapons from each other, creating a strategic element where they can **hinder the opposing team's ability to score points.**

{{<section title="More interactable objects" >}}
Another idea is to **increase the number of interactable objects** within the game world. These objects would provide more opportunities for interaction and exploration, enriching the game's environment and player engagement.

{{<section title="Placing virtual barriers to promote movement" >}}
We're also thinking about incorporating e.g. virtual walls in the game's design. These walls would **encourage players to move around more**, adding a physical aspect to the gameplay and making it more dynamic and immersive.
