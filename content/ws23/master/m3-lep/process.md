In the project's initial phase, we conducted thorough research to establish a robust foundation for our web application. 
This involved exploring diverse technology stacks, evaluating **programming languages, databases, and frameworks**. 
We studied similar applications for inspiration and best practices. The implementation of **timetable and schedule-solving 
algorithms** was a key focus, with a careful assessment of existing solutions. We directly **engaged with the planning team**, 
gaining insights into manual planning methods and specific requirements. Familiarity with provided data, including subjects and 
teacher preferences, guided our application design. The planning process included **identifying constraints** for the solver, 
from basic scheduling rules to department-specific requirements. This comprehensive research laid the groundwork for 
effective planning, development, and the successful implementation of our web application.

In the second phase, our team engaged in **creative brainstorming and prototyping** to mold the structure and design of the project. 
We utilized FigJam as a proficient platform for collaborative brainstorming sessions, where we delved into discussions regarding 
the **optimal structure of the database**. Our focus was on defining entities and outlining the overall architecture of the database. 
Transitioning to Figma, our team dedicated efforts to prototyping, with a specific emphasis on the front-end (FE) design. 
This phase involved meticulously defining the user interface and experience. Our goal was to ensure a **user-friendly and visually 
appealing design** that seamlessly aligned with the project's objectives.

{{<section title="Development & Testing:">}}
The concluding phase revolved around the actual development and testing of the application. We adopted an Agile **SCRUM** methodology, 
fostering efficient collaboration within the development team and ensuring a streamlined workflow. The use of GitHub Project as a project 
management tool played a crucial role in facilitating effective issue tracking and resolution. In this phase, the application was 
implemented following a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** approach, encompassing both the front-end (FE) and back-end (BE) components. 
To ensure the robustness of the application, **comprehensive unit tests** were conducted, with a particular focus on constraints 
identified during the initial research. **User testing** was a collaborative effort with the coordinators to gather feedback on usability. 
Simultaneously, **manual testing** was performed by the team to identify and fix any unforeseen issues, thereby guaranteeing 
a polished and reliable final product.
