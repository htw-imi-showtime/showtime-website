{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The goal of our project was to develop a game together with the NABU about the Water Scarcity in Brandenburg. Gaming For Future, is a  single-player strategy, environmental simulation, and awareness game centered around the critical issue of water scarcity. Our goal was it with this game to draw people’s attention to the crucial issue of water scarcity through
Game-Based Learning approach.

NABU (Naturschutzverband e.V) is an NGO with approximately 900,000 members (more than 1% of the population)
environmental education, spreading of public awareness, cooperations with local groups,
institutions and authorities to promote nature-friendly policies

{{<section title="Gameplay">}}
Core elements: 
Biome tiles:
Biome tiles to reconstruct  ecosystem by placing different biome tiles.

Thresholds:
Each biome tile affects temperature and ground water level differently.


The player can place biome tiles on the map. Each tile has different influences on the water level.
Level Selection:
Each level  visualised different initial environment conditions (ground water level & temperature) and unique threshold values

Challenge:
The challenge lies in the learning process, where players must discern the impact of each biome tile on the ecosystem.

Winning / Losing:
Players must navigate and manipulate these environmental factors, ensuring they remain within specified threshold values unique to each level
