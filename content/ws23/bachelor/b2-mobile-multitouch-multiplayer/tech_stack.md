{{<section title="Project Management">}}

In our project toolkit, we used various tools to keep things organized and clear. Notion was our main hub, providing flexibility along with the helpful Education Abo Option. Google Apps, such as TaskBoard for daily tasks and Calendar for sprint scheduling, helped us stay on course easily.

To see our progress visually, we created a lively Miro board connected to our Gantt Chart, adding color and energy to our project tracking. And when it was time for Showtime Preparation, Confluence was our reliable guide, making sure every detail was in the right place.

{{<section title="Communication">}}

In the world of project communication, keeping a smooth flow was crucial for our progress. We usually had our sprint meetings with Supervisor Prof. Tobias Lenz at the university, which allowed for direct communication and quick updates.

When faced with disruptions like strikes, bad weather, or holidays, we switched our communication to platforms like WhatsApp and Discord to maintain continuous connection and exchange information. For collaborative work and screen-sharing, we relied on Zoom, making teamwork and shared insights more effective.

{{<section title="Development">}}

In the world of game development, we used Unity as our main platform to create our game. We harnessed the strength of C# coding and used Visual Studio Code for detailed programming tasks. For smooth collaboration and version control, we depended on Git and GitHub to manage and share our code with each other.

{{<section title="Design">}}

In our design work, we focused on creating characters using Photoshop, along with additional design elements from the Unity Asset Store. Building the website required us to use Markdown and Hugo as our design tools, which helped us achieve a stylish and visually appealing online presence. For presentations and other design tasks, we used Canva to add creativity and finesse to our visuals.
