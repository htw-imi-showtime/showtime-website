{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
With Vision.IO, we want to show that it is possible to expand augmented reality. Simple interactions, such as pressing a button, turning a knob or exchanging objects in the real world, change the augmented world.
To illustrate this interaction, our model shows what the world will look like in 2050. Based on the interactions, you can adjust the energy mix, rebuild factories or replace houses and thus decide how sustainable the individual sectors are.
