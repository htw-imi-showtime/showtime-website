{{<section title="Future">}}
Our project is very open and creates a basis for extended reality. You can consider incorporating new interactions, such as switches or touch panels, or changing the platform and running the project on a tablet or VR glasses.
New use cases can also be devised and tested. This project could be used very well in industry for maintenance work on machines and establish communication from the machine to the goggles.
