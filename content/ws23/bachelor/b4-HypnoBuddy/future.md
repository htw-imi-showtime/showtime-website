---

- As we reflect on our current achievements, we envision a future where our web application evolves into an essential tool for diverse forms of mental therapy. Here are key areas where we see potential for improvement:

{{<section title="Therapy Session Calendar">}}
**Streamlining Appointment Management**
  
To streamline the therapeutic process, we plan to incorporate a comprehensive Therapy Session Calendar. This feature would empower therapists and clients to create or request new appointments directly within the app. This ensures that therapists have all relevant information about their patients consolidated in one platform, fostering a more efficient and organized workflow.

**Gamifying the User Experience**

Improving the intuitiveness of our roadmap is a key focus. We aim to make the interface more user-friendly, introducing features such as drag-and-drop functionality for seamless navigation. Inspired by gamification principles, we aspire to make the UI more engaging, drawing inspiration from platforms like Duolingo to create a visually appealing and interactive experience.

{{<section title="Exercise Feature">}}
**Flexibility and Feedback**

Our Exercise Feature will be refined to provide therapists with the capability to create/upload exercises within the app. Patients can then upload their results, allowing therapists to offer feedback or make notes for subsequent sessions. This feature will prioritize flexibility, ensuring therapists can customize exercises for various formats, including audio files for meditation recorded by the therapists themselves. The goal is to save time and enhance the overall effectiveness of therapeutic exercises.

{{<section title="Feature Connection">}}
**Seamless Integration for Holistic Insights**

Connecting different features will be a pivotal improvement to create a more seamless user experience. For instance, integrating therapists' notes from the Exercise, Roadmap, and Journal features into the calendar will provide therapists with a consolidated view of important information. This interconnected approach aims to enhance the overall therapeutic process, providing a holistic understanding of the patient's journey.
