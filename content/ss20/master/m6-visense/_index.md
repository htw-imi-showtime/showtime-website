## About the project
Vi-Sense is a project that visualizes data of heating systems in a 3D model of the building they’re installed in. Technicians or system administrators get an overview of all sensors located in a building, can take a closer look at the measured values of these sensors, and get information about data anomalies that indicate potential errors. The combination of the 3D representation of buildings and the visualization of measured values in a timeline makes it possible to perform detailed analyses of error sources such as the failure of heating or pump systems. In addition, sensor states in the building model are supported by color highlighting, which ensures a quick orientation and an intuitive overview. In short, the goal of Vi-Sense is to give technicians and building managers a clear overview of their properties and the sensor technology they use.

### About the Project
#### Project Goals
1. web application for visualization of IoT sensor data in building models
2. anomaly detection analysis of measured values by calculating gradients and defining limit values for each sensor
3. timeline chronological monitoring and comparison of sensor data
4. mesh coloring colored representation of the measured values on sensor meshes in the 3D model
5. sensor meshes documentation of sensor locations in the 3D model
