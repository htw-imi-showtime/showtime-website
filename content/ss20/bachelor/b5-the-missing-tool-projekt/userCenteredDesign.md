### Whatever you need, whenever you need it

We made a huge progress in defining our final product vision when we asked ourselves what the specific use cases for our product were. We wanted to provide a tool that gives you the freedom to do what you need to do at the specific moment to make your group-project work, but that doesn't overwhelm you with fancy features that you most likely won't make any use of.

### Use cases
A typical use case reads as following: I am a student having an online-class in one of the numerous online video-conferencing tools and the professor asks me to brainstorm ideas on a specific topic with others. Because of TheMissingTool I have a handy application that can be opened in no-time and where I and the other students can create new ideas on cards, connect ideas with each other and talk about it in the chat.

Another use case is that the professor asks the students to split in groups based on the topics that just came up while brainstorming. In this case, each student can simply select the topic that seems most interesting to him/her and directly jump to another board from the existing card on the board. All students that click on the same link are then in a new board where they immediately can start working on their ideas.


### Less is more

We put our focus on a great user experience and less on fancy features that most likely won't get used frequently. That's why we shaped our tool to the point where we can say that it is actually fun working with it!

### Usability Tests

To achieve a great experience for our users we did two iterations of Usability Testing where we gave some students who had never seen our tool before some specific tasks and observed their reactions, suggestions and the difficulties they had using our board. By doing numerous tests we were able to find even the smallest bugs or hurdles that we would not have found ourselves and could adjust our product after each iteration to provide a better experience for future test candidates.
