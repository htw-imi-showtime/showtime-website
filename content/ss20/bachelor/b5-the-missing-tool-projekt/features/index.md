{{<section title="Show me your cards!">}}

The main features of our tool include creating boards with notes on which you can collect ideas, communicate with each other and find new working groups. We tried to make our tool as user-friendly as possible and reduced unnecessary things so the thought process does not get interrupted. This is why The Missing Tool is so lightweight – you don't even need to create a user account!

Let us show you what you can do in detail.

{{<section title="Brainstorm ideas">}}
You can write as much or as little text as you want to, change the color of your cards anytime and connect cards with each other to show that they belong together. Five different shapes give enough room to express ideas and to make your thoughts visually appealing.

{{<section title="Communicate in real-time">}}
You are not alone in this! Everyone can comment on cards and you can see who is working on which card at any time – but you can also stay anonymous, just choose any username you want to! When there is more to discuss or you simply want to chit-chat, you can use the chat – and don't worry to miss anything! Your are notified if there are new messages.

{{<section title="Find working groups">}}
The feature we are most proud of is the simple process of creating new study groups! Simply create a new card, give it a title, choose the link icon in the tool menu and a small icon will appear on the card, indicating that it leads to another board. Everyone who wants to join you there can simply click on it and you start working on a new board! If you decide differently, just jump back and choose another group to work with!

You can also move cards from one board to another, by simply draggin on the card and pulling it to the one that leads to the new board! Magical, right?
