{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Urban energy is a young company from Berlin Kreuzberg with the mission to contribute to the energy transition through intelligent software. With ZeroC we are developing a software-as-a-service solution for the energy and CO2 management of buildings. This is based on our conviction that every property can be CO2-neutral. An important building block for energy and CO2 management is the regular collection of consumption data. Since there are still no digital meters in many buildings and the rollout of smart meters is progressing slowly, this is often done by reading the meter, which is error-prone, time-consuming and disruptive. Therefore, this app should enables simple, automated and secure collection of consumption data.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We’re a diverse international team with different background who got together by this project. This is was our first time developing a mobile app on React Native. Not everyone has previous experience with React, so during the development we learned a lot together by helping each other.
