card_description = "Citizen Hero is an attempt to translate citizens' priorities into political decisions. Citizen Hero allows users to keep track of all upcoming and previous climate change related votings in the German Parliament. A user can see how and when their representatives voted on these issues, and if they believe their representatives are not doing enough, templates addressing those concerns can be personalized and sent to the representatives within minutes."

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}

Representatives are chosen by the public to make decisions on their behalf and act in their best interests. **Climate change** is a very serious challenge, and although awareness is growing, there is still not enough being done.

**Our mission** is to make every citizen a hero by providing them with the tools they need to be more **proactive**, **informed**, and **vigilant**. We want to provide a platform where people can hold their representatives accountable for their actions and reach out to them easily. We also want the average citizen to be more informed about government policies and actions, since only then will we be able to see real and significant changes when the needed policies are shaped at government level.
