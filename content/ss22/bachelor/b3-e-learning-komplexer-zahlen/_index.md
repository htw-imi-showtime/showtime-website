{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
We are driven by goals and we do a lot to get closer to them each day. We all also know that it can sometimes be 
challenging that there are obstacles put in our way. According to **our expert**, complex numbers are often exactly that 
for many **electrical engineering students** during their studies. Most of them have **no prior knowledge** from school or other 
areas in this topic. Nevertheless, the subject area plays an **essential role** for later problems. Complex numbers are for 
example used to **calculate complex alternating currents** (AC) and therefore the knowledge must be present. 
The transfer of this knowledge has so far been approached via the **classical route** and, as already mentioned, has often 
represented a crossroads for some students. That's why we want to spice up the world of complex numbers to make learning
easier for our fellow students with a **playful learning app**.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
At the beginning, our small team of five was heavily involved in research around the topic of complex numbers and alternating current. 
The core of the project was, of course, the development phase. Here we divided into three main groups.

📄 **Research, concept, project management:** Nell

🎨 **Assets:** Jana

🧑🏻‍💻 **Development Team:**

        Richard: Technical lead & developer 
        Robert: Developer 
        Nina: Developer
