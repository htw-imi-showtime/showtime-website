{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Tired of **non-interactive** math tutorials? Still, unsure what complex numbers are really used for? Then follow along our 
**complex space adventure** and learn how to deal with complex numbers in a **playful way**. Based on the **principles of game-based 
learning**, our complex space adventure prototype teaches you conversions, formulas, and different coordinate systems. 
Take your chance and become the **new complex numbers ace**.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
At the beginning, our small team of five was heavily involved in research around the topic of complex numbers and alternating current. 
The core of the project was, of course, the development phase. Here we divided into three main groups.

📄 **Research, concept, project management:** Nell

🎨 **Assets:** Jana

🧑🏻‍💻 **Development Team:**

        Richard: Technical lead & developer 
        Robert: Developer 
        Nina: Developer
