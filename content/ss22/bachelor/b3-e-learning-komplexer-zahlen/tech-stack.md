## WhatsApp/Discord
For our daily communication we used Discord and WhatsApp. With these apps, we could check in with everyone, ask how 
things were going, or ask for help. Using Discord, we could also hold a spontaneous meeting if something else needed to 
be discussed.<br>
## Jira
We used Jira to create tickets and a backlog to keep track of our project. It helped us define and implement weekly and 
holistic goals. It also allowed us to get an overview of the project status together.
## Zoom
Otherwise, we used Zoom for our weekly meetings. There we discussed more details, planned the next week, reviewed and 
improved what was done the week before. 
## Medibang
The design of our game adds the right flavor to it. Although the credits for it go to our asset designer Jana, we want 
to mention here what platform she used for her masterpieces.
## Google Drive
We used Drive mainly to share knowledge when we were doing research. We also used it to create our concepts and share 
data. Drive opened the possibility for us to work together on documents at the same time. This way, we could help each 
other out or double check when needed. Since Google and its functionalities are widely known and available for any 
system, this was the perfect way for us.

## Unity
We chose Unity for the development of our game. Among other reasons, because most of our team already had experience 
with it, so it was easier and faster to get started.

## Github
Github was the interface for collaboration between all of us. Since each of us already had some experience, it made the 
collaborative work process much easier. This allowed us to collaborate in a focused way without any issues.
