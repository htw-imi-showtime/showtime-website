## Styles
To have the style of the video match your taste, we are providing 4 different styles, with which the music videos can be generated (water, architecture, modern art and three dimensional). Choose one of the styles and you will get a video with images fitting the theme that you selected.

## Presets
With the presets you have a set of tools, with which you can automatically match the video output to the dynamics and genre of your track. For every preset we suggest different genres and types of music that fit for it. You can now choose, what dynamics your video should have to match your song.

## Expert Settings
With the expert settings you can tweak the dynamics of the video to your liking with high precision. For every parameter we have a detailed explanation on our tutorial site to help you understand what the expert settings are capable of. Use these sliders and switches to further improve the videos that you generate and exactly match them to your imagination.

{{<section title="Audio Analysis" >}}
The audio analysis, takes a good look into the features of your song. Through the expert settings you can tweak how much the bass, mid and high frequencies should influence the dynamic of your video. Our analysis also detects characteristic changes in the song and segments the audio into parts that can then be individually visualized. The final loudness curve and each characteristic change in the music is finally passed on to the video generation to create a video that plays to your song.

{{<section title="Video Generation" >}}
The video generation of our product represents the most important part of Bloompipe. Here the image generation takes place with a generative adversarial network by Nvidia called StyleGAN-ada-pytorch. StyleGAN is designed to generate beautiful images from random input vectors. For your video we are calculating a set of input vectors that represent the dynamics in your music. This vector set can  be influenced by choosing one of our presets or using the expert settings. We then generate images for every frame in the video. At the end our post production, these images are consolidated into a final video with some added saturation, contrast. After all is done, your track will be underlayed. Voila, hereâ€™s your video.
