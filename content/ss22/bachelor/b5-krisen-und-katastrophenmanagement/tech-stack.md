## Slack
We used Slack as our **main communication and organisation-tool** while working on our project. There we could easily gather information and share links that are relevant for our project. Slack also was a good platform to discuss and quickly inform eachother about current problems and difficulties.

## Trello
Trello was used to keep track of our **Backlog**.

## GitHub
For making it easier for us to **work on the same codebase together** and handle **version control** we used GitHub. And as we all were already familiar with it, it is easy to use and it is also a good practice for later jobs we didn't even had to talk about wether to use it or not.

## Strato,WhatsApp
As secondary communication-tools we used Strato and WhatsApp.

## Visual Studio Code
Our team used Visual Studio Code as text editor, because it offers the best compatibility and makes working with libraries like React very easy.

## Figma
For getting a first idea of what our app could look like and what functionality we want to include we used Figma to create a first click through mock-up in the beginning and developed it further during the development process to visualise our ideas. Additionally we also used the **design** from our mock-up for our prototype.

## React.js
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Because of already existing experience with React in our frontend team and it having a great documentation and a lot of tutorials it was the library of our choice.

## MongoDB
We use MongoDB as a **document-oriented NoSQL database** management system that makes it easy to organize all data.

## Mongoose
To **simplyfiy** our data management we decided to use Mongoose as a straight-forward, **schema-based** solution to model the application data.
