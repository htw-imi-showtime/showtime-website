Every project has a beginning and an end. Before we started doing anything, we were discussing possible ideas for a project. We had to do something with the new <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? To begin with, we had a many questions, and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro board.

{{<section title="Assets creation (a selection)">}}
One of our focus was to create some various assets ourselves using the software Blender. This point was important to us, because self-created assets give the project more independence. Nevertheless, we also made use of existing assets. In the following, you will see a selection of our self-made assets for the project.<br><br>
Our project features a medieval wall. And this wall has small roofs.

This is the wall with the small roofs. The whole wall including the gate was built entirely by ourself. This asset is part of a riddle that must be solved in order to pass through the gate. Teamwork is required!

Our world offers a small riddle where several mirrors play an important role. These mirrors are located in a cave. The cave is cold and wet and the mirror suffered - it is completely rotten and dirty.

This asset here is a tribute to the developers of the Unreal Engine. This asset is the logo of the game Unreal Tournament from 1999, and can be seen in various places in the demo.

{{<section title="Project Management">}}
For our project, we adopted for an agile project management. But instead of opting for a concrete methodology and strictly going down that road, we only took methods that were  practical and beneficial for us. Those were mostly scrum methods.

We held our jour fixe to inform the others on our progress on a weekly basis instead of daily. Our sprints had a duration of 2 weeks, ending with a release for the upcoming review. After the sprint review with our supervisor, we immediately held our sprint retrospective and partly started the planning for the next iteration by breaking down the new input we had received and deciding on what needs to be discussed for the next sprint. The first weekly jour fixe after a sprint had ended was simultaneously our sprint planning phase for the next one.

For task handling, we ended up using a combination of the kanban board and the scrum backlog.
