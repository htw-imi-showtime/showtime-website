Every project has a beginning and an end. Before we started doing anything, we were discussing possible ideas for a project. We had to do something with the new <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? In the beginning we had a lot of questions and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro board.

{{<section title="Project Management">}}
For our project we adopted for an agile project management. But instead of opting for a concrete methodology and strictly going down that road, we only took methods that were  practical and beneficial for us. Those were mostly scrum methods.

We held our jour fixe to inform the others on our progress on a weekly basis instead of daily. Our sprints had a duration of 2 weeks ending with a release for the upcoming review. After the sprint review with our supervisor we immediately held our sprint retrospective and partly started the planning for the next iteration by breaking down the new input we had received and deciding on what needs to be discussed for the next sprint. The first weekly jour fixe after a sprint had ended was simultaneously our sprint planning phase for the next one.

For task handling we ended up using a combination of the kanban board and the scrum backlog.
