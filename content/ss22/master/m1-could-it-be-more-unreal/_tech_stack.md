* <strong>Illustrator</strong><br>
Adobe Illustrator is a vector based graphics program for creating the icons of the radial menu and the graphics for the tutorial screen.
* <strong>Indesign</strong><br>
To create a quick storyboard, a self-created template in InDesign was used. This gave us the opportunity to iterate more quickly in the process of finding the visual language for the trailer.

{{<section title="Photogrammetry">}}
* <strong>Meshroom</strong><br>
Free photogrammetry tool to turn our photos into rough 3D-Models for the busts in the final part of the game.
* <strong>Polycam</strong><br>
Polycam was used for photogrammetry scans where Meshroom did not give the desired result. Polycam seemed promising at first because it uses a Lidar sensor in addition to the images, but in the end only the Photo mode was used because it provided a higher level of detail.

{{<section title="Version Control">}}
* <strong>Git (HTW GitLab)</strong><br>
Git is a free software for distributed version management of files. In this project, Git was used in combination with the Large File System. Git turned out to be the most cost-effective solution, but not necessarily the best technical combination with the Unreal Engine.
* <strong>SmartGit</strong><br>
SmartGit is a graphical Git Client that was especially useful for selectively reverting unwanted changes on branches so they could be safely merged into the main branch.
