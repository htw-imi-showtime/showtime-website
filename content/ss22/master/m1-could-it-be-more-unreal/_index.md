{{<section title="The Objective">}}

On April 5, 2022, Unreal Engine 5 was officially released. This was a perfect timing for us as a team! The new version of the engine offers many new features, which we wanted to take a closer look on. We dealt with the Nanite Virtualized Geometry System, the MetaHuman Creator, Niagara Fluid Simulation and many more Features.

The result of our project is a playable showcase demo which supports many of the new features. We built a living world with wandering animals, flying insects, dense woods, a dark cave, medieval buildings and different small riddles to make the playable showcase demo as an experience. We also included an online multiplayer with Steam to experience the world not alone, but together!
