{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of 8 people in total. This semester, we decided to develop a playable Unreal Engine 5 showcase demo.
Each of us had different prior knowledge of the Unreal Engine at the beginning of the project. In the past 4 months we have done our best to demonstrate the new features of the Unreal Engine 5 in a short playable demo. In the process we also encountered various challenges, be it 
the hardware-hungry Unreal Engine 5, unstable performance or the lack of sufficient repository space.

Eventually, we managed to create a showcase demo which includes some of the most new important features. We would have liked to include many more, but unfortunately the very limited time did not allow us doing that.

Since we are a big team, we split up into groups at the beginning of the project to manage the very diverse tasks efficiently.

Max, Till, Holzi and Rika developed the concept for the demo. Furthermore, Max, Till and Holzi took care of the assets and level design. Especially, Max's self-made assets made the demo even more immersive. Till also gave life to the characters through animation.

Rika, Marino, Dominic and Jördis took care of the implementation of the different puzzle logics, NPCs and other smaller features.

Hendrik was responsible for everything that had to do with lighting, the implementation of a real-time fluid simulation and contributed a lot to the atmosphere. Additionally, Hendrik and Till also took care of the creation of the showcase trailer.

Due to the limitation of the available hardware, Holzi and Hendrik worked hard to optimize the showcase demo continuously.  

Dominic also took over the role of our team leader, was responsible for the multiplayer, was our gitmaster and took care of the creation of this website.

The teamwork worked very well, and we are all very proud and satisfied with our showcase demo!
