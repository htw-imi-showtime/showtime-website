Due to very limited time and lack of performance optimization, we weren't able to include all features the Unreal Engine 5 has to offer. However, what we might to take a closer look on in the future and <i>fully</i> implement it into our showcase demo could be the following:
* <i>Full</i> utilization of 3D Niagara Fluid Simulation<br>
* <i>Deeper</i> insight of MetaHuman Creator
* <i>Extended</i> use of Nanite Virtualized Geometry System
