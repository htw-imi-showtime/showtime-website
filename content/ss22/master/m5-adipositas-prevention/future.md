{{<section title="What more is possible?" >}}
In our conception phase, we came up with a whole bunch of other ideas that we couldn't implement within the limited number of weeks. Here we list a few of these ideas to illustrate the potential that still lies in the app.

{{<section title="Chatbot" >}}
After the initial registration, the user is supposed to specify questions about his eating habits and exercise habits with the help of a chatbot. An intelligent chatbot is particularly appealing to children and thus increases the fun factor of the app.

{{<section title="More educational content" >}}
We believe that awareness and education is an important key to a lasting healthier life. Therefore, we have planned to provide more prepared content to users in order to provide more knowledge about nutrition and exercise.

{{<section title="More movement challenges" >}}
More walking is a good start, but that's not where the exercise should stop: we plan to offer more exercise challenges customized to the user's fitness level.

{{<section title="Send motivational messages" >}}
We know that sometimes it's hard to stay on track: that's why users on a team should be able to send motivational push notifications to each other, signaling: "Hey, we can do this together!"

{{<section title="Usage for children without smartphones" >}}
Although most kids today own smartphones, there are some who don't. We still want to enable such families to use our app: There should be a feature that allows parents to manage profiles for their children in their own profile and enter progress for them.
