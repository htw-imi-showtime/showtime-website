{{<section title="Initial Analysis" >}}
After the initial registration, the user is asked about their previous exercise and eating habits. By analyzing this data, we assign users to a **level of health awareness** according to the ["Stages of Change"](https://medicine.llu.edu/academics/resources/stages-change-model) model. From the data provided, e.g. the amount of fruit and vegetables eaten daily, and the calculated awareness level, we then calculate a percentage increase in the initial value, which forms the basis for the defined goals in the weekly challenge.

{{<section title="Start A Weekly Challenge" >}}
The main functionality of our app is to **improve your habits a bit each week** through weekly challenges. Therefore, users get a challenge with recalculated goals every week and see what they have accomplished at the end of each week.
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Keep Track Of Your Goals" >}}
The weekly goals are sub-calculated to each day of the week, so you don't immediately see the big mountain of challenges in front of you, but small, **easily manageable units each day**. And if you don't manage to reach your goals on one day, you can simply make up for it on another day. *Your life is flexible, and so is the app!*

{{<section title="Move More" >}}
AdyBuddy is based on a multimodal approach: exercise, nutrition and education. Exercise represents the first pillar. Children today move less than they did a few years ago. Therefore the user is given a daily step goal to achieve. More exercise challenges are planned for future releases to bring **more physical activities into the user's everyday life.**

{{<section title="Eat Better" >}}
The second pillar is nutrition. Based on their previous habits, users are suggested, for example, how many servings of fruit they should eat per day or the maximum number of snacks they should consume. Users can indicate with a tap whether they have just drunk a glass of water or eaten an apple and always have an eye on how many portions haven't been consumed yet. This creates an **awareness of what is actually consumed throughout the day**, something that most people are often not even aware of.

{{<section title="Educate Yourself" >}}
Education and awareness are the basis for making *good and healthy choices*. With the help of **weekly quizzes**, not only children, but also adults, learn a lot about the ingredients of food in their everyday lives. If you ever answer a question incorrectly, you can always go back, because **repetition consolidates knowledge**.

{{<section title="Work As A Team" >}}
Numerous studies have shown that sustainable change can only take place if the **family or friendly environment is also involved**. Therefore, a core functionality of the app is that you can start a **weekly challenge together as a team**, the success of which depends largely on all team members achieving their own weekly goals. If a team member has a lull, the others can motivate him or her to keep going. This creates a sense of community, which makes change easier.

{{<section title="Improve Every Week" >}}
Most fitness or weight loss programs have a problem: the initial goal has been reached, and from there on you can stop with the good habits, right? To counteract this, we have developed a system that **encourages users to improve or strengthen their habits a little more each week**. Every week, we calculate the goals for the next week, depending on how the previous week went for the user. This is the most **personalized program** available at the moment.

{{<section title="Get Rewarded" >}}
Did you eat your target amount of fruit this week? Great! Did you reach your weekly goal several times in a row? Even better! Small rewards in the form of badges are meant to highlight goals already achieved and motivate you to stay on the ball.

{{<section title="Choose Your Buddy" >}}
*We know that change can be scary.* That's why our "AdyBuddy" accompanies the user throughout the app, creating a feeling of having a friend by your side to help you through the changes. You can choose from two different buddies: Foxy, the dear fox, or Paul, the cute dog.
