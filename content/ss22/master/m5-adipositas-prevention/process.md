{{<section title="Research">}}

As the very first step of our research, we read multiple **studies** and articles on the topic obesity and obesity reduction or prevention in adults as well as in children in order to understand the physiological, psychologial and environmental factors influencing the success or failure of attempted weight loss reduction or weight gain prevention. We summaraized our research results on a Miro Board where we collected all our future ideas from there. We answered questions about our **target group** and focus points of our projects. 

As a next step, we conducted a **market analysis**: there are already a lot of health and weight related applications on the market, what distinguishes them from one another and what do they all have in common? We didn't want to just become the 100th app you can use to eventually – mostly unsuccessfully – to lose weight. This is what gave us our unique selling point: most apps focus on the individual. We focus on the **power of shared success**.

After we had done all the research and collected all the ideas, we started to work intensivly on the concept of our application. This process took longer than we expected it to take, but we really wanted to *make sure we had a stable base on which to build our app*. During these weeks we also talked to **sports scientist** Sascha Ketelhut and **psychologist** Janina Krassa to give us additional insights. They provided us with some ideas related to topics such as how to measure individual progress and awareness for nutrition and movement.

After the rough concept was in place, one team created a **User Story Map**, based on which we planned our MVP and further releases. Another team has been working on the **details of the challenges** that form the basis of our app and how the individual needs of a user could be measured in order to provide **tailored assitance** in the change of the users habits. We needed to make sure to design an application that young children as well as their parents could use to *reach their goals as a team*, or family indeed.
