card_description = "Berlin has a lot of hidden history. Sometimes there are still noticeable traces of it today, but other times nothing is left. The 'What happened here' app aims to bridge the gap between the past and the present and make history visible again. With its location based notification feature, you can walk through Berlin and get notified if you are walking past a point with a historic background and learn about it via the app. Information about cultural, historical and social issues can be gathered in our WH2 Editor by different institutions in multiple languages."

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Oftentimes, people walk past places with distinctive histories without even realizing. With our project we want to provide users with access to information about important cultural, historical and social events and connect this information to places around them. The location based notifications are designed to make it as simple as possible for the users to engage with these topics in their day-to-day lives. They can also share newly found information with other people and personalize their area and topics of interest.

The editor is designed for institutions that want to share information and draw attention to different topics. They can manage their places and assets while categorizing them, so that users can easily find them.

The app currently only offers data about places in Berlin, but this is not a limitation. Users are able to select between English and German, which opens up the possibility to add other languages in the future.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The WH2 team consists of four students with experience in web and app development, even though this tech stack was new to everybody. One team member was mainly responsible for the backend, one for the app and two for the editor. But in general, everyone helped in all areas.
