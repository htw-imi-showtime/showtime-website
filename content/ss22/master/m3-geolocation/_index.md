card_description = "Berlin has a lot of hidden history. Sometimes there are still noticeable traces of it today, but other times nothing is left. The 'What happened here' app aims to bridge the gap between the past and the present and make history visible again. With its location based notification feature, you can walk through Berlin and get notified if you are walking past a point with a historic background and learn about it via the app. Information about cultural, historical and social issues can be gathered in our Editor by different institutions in multiple languages."
