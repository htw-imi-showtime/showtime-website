The next step for our project is to contact more institutions who want to cooperate with us. We mainly want to focus on those who treat cultural, historical and social issues. The concept of the app will flourish when more data is added that users can discover.

To expand the App we want to include the option to have predefined routes that users can actively choose to explore different neighbourhoods and topics. Just like the notification feature, walking close by a POI on a route could for example start the audio. We also discussed the option to include gamification in our app. This would allow users to gather points by visiting different POI and gain achievements for it.

Our first goal is to include the option to add more data to a POI in the format of text and video.

Furtheremore it would be great to add import options to add POI from Excel Sheets for example. This would make the initial creation process of the POI easier and quicker and allow the institutions to add more of their information to the app.
