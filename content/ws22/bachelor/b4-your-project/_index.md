{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The template was created to demonstrate to other engineers at Idealo about working with AWS CDK and serverless resources, to show how easy they are to set up and what they can do.

{{<section title="The team">}}
Our team consists of 4 IMI students from different semesters. All of us have not worked with AWS yet and none of us have had any experience with Node.js and TypeScript prior to this project so it was quite a challenge.
