{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The template was created to:
- demonstrate to other engineers at idealo how to work with AWS CDK and serverless resources, show how easy they are to set up and what they can do
- shorten the development lifecycle 
- eliminate always-on VMs (save maintenance costs)
- scale automatically (save operational costs)
- only pay by demand (save instance costs)

{{<section title="The team">}}
Our small team consists of 4 IMI students from different semesters, with different levels of programming experience and interests. None of us had worked with AWS before and neither had any experience with Node.js and TypeScript before this project, so it was quite a challenge for us.
