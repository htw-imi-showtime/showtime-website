## WhatsApp / Zoom
Since we were only a small project group, we primarily used **WhatsApp** for communication and coordination. Longer meetings and our weekly standup were mostly held in **presence**.

For exceptions and pair programming we used **zoom**.

## Miro
We used Miro for our organization, planning, conception and **weekly standup**. The very visual tool gave us the perfect opportunity to create clear **dashboards** to plan next steps, milestones and features.

## Drive
We use **Google drive** as a repository for documents, images and other files used and shared for the project. 

These included concepts, documentation, test lists, graphics and texts. Through the simple rights management, files could also be shared quickly with the **stakeholders**.

## Docs
For us it was important to write, manage and share documents **quickly and easily**. We also wanted to collaborate on documents **live**. For this we used google docs, because everyone already had a Google account due to the other tools and the use was **free** for us.
