We want to make the App easy to use and adjustable. Our plan is to make an all in one app, so that Artists can use it for their own shows, adjust it to their needs and can help to improve it via open source and modding options.

{{<section title="Additional Features">}}
Our project has many opportunities for new features. We want to make it more variable so that you can use it for different shows, change visualization presets in the app or activate effects on runtime. Even different options for user input, for example movements, pictures and artificially abstracted versions of the user input are ideas we are thinking about.
