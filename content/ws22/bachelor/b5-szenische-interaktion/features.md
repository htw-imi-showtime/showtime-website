The WebApp gives visitors a variety of functions and information. The visitor should be given the opportunity to get an overview of past and upcoming events. Furthermore, each event should have a title, start and duration as well as a track list with the songs played at the event. 

In the run-up to an event, the audience can submit their own small drawings via a website for the individual songs that will be played at the event. These drawings are then played as an animation during the concert, so that all spectators can clearly recognize their input:

The main part for our project is the visualization app that we build via Unity. It communicates with the music analyser Tool, to visualize the live music, and with the Web app to get the collected user input. Our visualization is realized with the Unity Particle System and with the VFX Graph. When the App is started you can start and stop the visualization of the user input, switch between songs, stop or change colors for the live input visualization.
