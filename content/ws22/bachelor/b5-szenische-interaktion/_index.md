{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The goal of the project is to create a stage design that the audience can actively shape in order to create a deeper bond during the concert. For this purpose, the audience will submit various drawings for the individual songs in the run-up to the concert. These will then be transformed into a stage design together with the live input of the band.
