{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The goal of Blubble is to facilitate the organization of book clubs. Whether non-fiction, novels or any other reading, Blubble makes it possible to focus fully on in-depth exchanges about what has been read and thus better understand the content. This improves the exchange about books and encourages the interest in creating and organizing a book club.
