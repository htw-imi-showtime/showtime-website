## Create, Discover, and Join Book Clubs

   Once you register in our app, you can create your own club centered around any book of your choice, be it nonfiction or fiction, which you can look up in OpenLibrary containing a vast collection of books from diverse genres and in various languages. After you have created your club, you become its moderator and can modify it by altering the name or increasing the number of members allowed to join. Furthermore, you can also participate in book clubs created by other people. You can find these clubs by their name, book title or author.

## Organize Discussions

   As a club moderator, you have the ability to initiate discussions on any topic of your choice, such as chapter discussions. Plan your discussion by identifying the topics you would like to address with other club members. Make sure to include a date, time and location for this and the app will notify users on their homepage about the upcoming discussion. You and other club members can contribute to the discussion by posting comments, which can also help shape the Agenda. Post a question or statement related to the chapter being discussed and accompany it with a quote or image. You can either select a picture from your gallery or take a photo using your phone camera. 
   
## Manage Time in Live Discussions

   The Blubble App offers a way to organize your discussions and keep track of time spent talking about each topic. The Live-Discussion feature allows you to monitor the progress of the discussion in real time, according to your own plan. Members of your club can join at any time to watch the discussion in progress, see where the discussion is, and how much time and topics are left to be covered. After the discussion is over, you can access your Agenda in the archive and use it to improve your management skills and plan for future discussions.

{{<section title="Future">}}
For now, we are proudly presenting our product as the fully implemented 1.0 beta version. In the future, we  plan to enhance the book club experience for our users even more, by expanding the existing features with quality of life changes.

With the next big update, we will elevate the social aspect by displaying the assigned notes for every subchapter in the ongoing discussion currently on the screen. We will also add the possibility to change the moderator of a discussion so that no planned discussion will be missed out.

Additionally, we plan to boost our user experience by adding push-notifications for changes made on upcoming discussions and by implementing the functionality to change user account data such as user email and password.

Please feel free to follow our progress as we are eager to develop more features to connect avid readers around the world through deep discussions about their favorite books.
