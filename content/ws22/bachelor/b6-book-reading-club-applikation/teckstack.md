{{<section title="Organisation and Communication">}}

To keep in touch and keep our communication up and running we used a multitude of well known platforms.

- Zoom for our monday meetings
- Teams for our hybrid thursday meetings
- WhatsApp for quick questions and coordination
- Slack for sharing resources and keeping in touch with Diva-E
- Trello for keeping track of our backlog and our progress on the tickets we wrote

{{<section title="Design">}}

**Miro**

Miro was an essential part of our first brainstorming sessions using its collaborative whiteboard. Here we went through the process from brainstorming ideas to boiling them down to our final features we would later implement as well as creating our first rough screens.

**Figma**

Our design team used Figma to finalize our previously sketched Screen designs that we made using Miro. Our figma board functioned as our stylesheet for the development team to rely on.

{{<section title="Frontend">}}
**Ionic React**

We decided on using Ionic React to quickly get our frontend up and running, while still having access to quality features and multi-platform development without the extra hassle. Using Ionicâ€™s included components we managed to quickly build our first prototype.

**Capacitor**

Capacitor is an open source native runtime which helped us bring our Ionic App to iOS and Android.

**Open Library**

We used the Open Library API to access and provide book information for our book clubs.

**Google Firebase Auth**

To easily implement user Authentication we used firebase Auth as it delivered the basic functionality we were looking for as well as Authorization through external services in case we wanted to implement these as well.

{{<section title="Backend">}}

**Node.js**

We used Node.js as our JavaScript runtime environment.

**Digital Ocean**

We used Digital Ocean to quickly host our backend container using the 200$ student credit Digital Ocean provides.

**Docker**

To minimize deployment effort we containerized our backend using Docker which allows us to easily switch Hosts if needed.

**Socket.io**

Socket.io delivers bidirectional and low-latency communication using websockets. We used this to host our live-discussions on our Backend server.

**Google Firestore**

Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development. We chose this service as our Database, as it really allowed us to build our first prototype very quickly.
