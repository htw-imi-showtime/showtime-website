Party games are fun, but there are often problems that interfere with the fun of the game that you just can't avoid: Specific cards might have known crinkles, parts of the game are missing, and some players just can't resist the urge to cheat a little here and there. 
The popular “card game” Werewolf (or [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))) - a discussion based party game -  is one of those games that might have these kinds of hindrances. 
So let us introduce to you:

the better Werewolf game, a local network based mobile application

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
While avoiding classic party game issues as mentioned above, not losing the social aspect of the game is something we tried to avoid by all means. With the tool, we want to encourage people to try out the game and create exciting discussion groups.

The app provides a simple way to set your social group up for playing the game, which improves the gaming experience while maintaining player interaction and keeping the game mostly outside the device. This improves the flow of the game and players learn the rules faster.

{{<section title="The team">}}
We are six students. Two of us have worked with Unity before, though network-related topics have been new to everyone. We tried putting people on Teams for Frontend and backend tasks, but in reality we helped each other out a lot and a clear separation was neither beneficial nor easy to create
