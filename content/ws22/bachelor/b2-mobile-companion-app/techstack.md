Discord allowed us to organize our communication efficiently, synchronous and asynchronous and enabled us to work together or present current topics via screen sharing.

Miro enabled a lot of planning and visualizing ideas, brainstorming etc.

Unity is the engine we used to create our app with. It is based on C#. We used Netcode network communication.

We used github to work asynchronous and merge the different versions of the project later on.

We want to express our gratitude to Yilei102 for providing us with original artworks for our project. Every portait-asset visible in our app and the logo has been designed by her. Thank you!

{{<section title="Future">}}

Werewolf offers a lot of diverse content concepts which would be very interesting to implement, such as a lot of interesting supporting roles throughout the game or different rulesets and variability of used roles. Also, it would be worth considering implementing a tool where the removed players could be entertained or even integrated into the game. Additionally, a graphical overhaul would be conceivable to make the game more descriptive. The project could be expanded in any area. Another idea of ours was to create a narrator, though one could argue that a feature like that could shift focus towards the phone too much.

We did our best within one semester to represent the party game Werewolf well and to provide a glimpse of all the possible features.
