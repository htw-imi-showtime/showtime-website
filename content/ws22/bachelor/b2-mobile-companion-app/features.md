Since the game no longer relies on physical cards and actually closing your eyes or f.e. laying your head onto your arms, we’re able to elude unnecessary complications. 
Despite that virtualization, the game is mainly determined by the verbal communication between the players on “game days”.
The rule structure can be quite complex depending on the player's experience and the choice of rules and roles, thus slowing down the dynamics of the player group. Through the simple presentation of the individual role tasks and their distribution, Softwærewolves avoids this problem. The entire game logic will be presented as a loop that helps to keep the game flow up, while new players can enjoy playing the game and learn the rules in the process. 
* **Roles**

In order to make the game fun for beginners and veterans alike, we did our best to include the most important and iconic roles the game has to offer. Next to the simple Villager and Werewolf, we included roles such as Lovers (Cupid), Seer and the Witch.

* **Game-Flow**

The whole logic of the game – including a voting system – has been virtualized and is being calculated as the game commences. Though, again, without the inclusion of the core part of the game: the discussion. That way, no experienced ‘game master’ or ‘narrator’ is needed, and no mistakes can be made when determining which stage of the game is happening next or what details should be unveiled.

* **Voting Systems**

There is a voting function in place for every essential vote the game has to offer: The determination of which convict should be ‘democratically removed’ next by the villagers, which target will be the next victim of the werewolves and even the witches ‘vote’ for whom she will be giving a potion to.
