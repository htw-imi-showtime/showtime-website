{{<section title="😊 Matching & Filter">}}
According to given profile information, a **specific matching score** will be calculated to find the best suiting buddy. Information like illnesses, occupations or languages are analyzed from the application to offer users most effective consultations. The higher the matching score is, the more **compatibility and similarity** between both users were determined. Not only does the user have the option to examine various user profiles with their score, but also **filter settings** are possible. For example age ranges, specific languages or occupations can be set.

{{<section title="🙋 Making contact">}}
A matching score displays the similarity, but users can still contact any person they like to. By having access to users profiles to get more information like motivation or experience, a user seeking support can decide for a **contact request at any time** with adding a **personal message** to it. Unfortunately not all buddies have the capacity to assist a user, which is why they can decline requests with a personal message too.

{{<section title="💬 Messaging">}}
After both users accept the request, a **personal chat room** will be created. Communication is key in every aspect in life, hence highly important for people struggling with mental health. A chat room offers a **safe space** for everyone. Users can see when others are online or have read their messages.
