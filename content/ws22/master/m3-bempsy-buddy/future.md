{{<section title="👥 Support Groups">}}
For greater support and help, support groups should be integrated in the application. These groups can help users to connect with a number of like-minded users which will make it easier to deal with complicated topics and share similar experiences. Additionally, users who are not BEM entitled or buddies can join these support groups anytime.

{{<section title="📹 Videos">}}
To reach out more people in need videos may operate as a useful medium to transfer personal and trusting messages. Users who already went through the BEM process can help others by talking about their experiences in a video and therefore motivate them. Furthermore, videos may help anxious users to introduce them slowly into the BEMpsy community without them needing to contact other people first.
