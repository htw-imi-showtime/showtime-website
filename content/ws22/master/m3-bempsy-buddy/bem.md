{{<section title="🤷‍♂️ What exactly does BEM stand for?">}}
BEM stands for **Betriebliches Eingliederungsmanagement** (company integration management). Since 2004, employers have been **required by law to offer BEM** to all employees who have been incapacitated for work for more than six weeks within a twelve-month period, regardless of the size of the company. The **legal basis** for this is the Ninth Book of the Social Code (§ 167 Par. 2 SGB IX).
