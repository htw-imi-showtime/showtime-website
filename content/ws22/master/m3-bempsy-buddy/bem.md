{{<section title="🤷‍♂️ What exactly does BEM stand for?">}}
BEM stands for Betriebliches Eingliederungsmanagement (company integration management). Since 2004, employers have been required by law to offer BEM to all employees who have been incapacitated for work for more than six weeks within a twelve-month period, regardless of the size of the company. The legal basis for this is the Ninth Book of the Social Code (§ 167 Par. 2 SGB IX).

An offer of BEM is also possible before the time period of six weeks and can be seen as a very useful form of prevention. The employee's participation in BEM is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time.
