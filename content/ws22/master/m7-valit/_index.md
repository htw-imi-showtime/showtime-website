This valuable insight for lecturers enables the creation of an interactive and dynamic learning environment where both students and lecturers can continuously improve. The end-of-semester evaluations provide a full picture of the students' academic experience, helping lecturers identify areas for improvement and fine-tune their teaching methods. Valit transforms academic teaching into a two-way conversation between students and lecturers, promoting growth and advancement in the learning process."

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Our goal is to supply students and teachers alike with a comprehensive tool for **instant and short term feedback** on their classes. By packaging easy to use student questionnaires, real-time feedback and concise evaluation analytics we hope to give lecturers a **more meaningful and deep insight into their teaching**. With Valit, students get more ways to express their learning successes and where they might be struggling compared to traditional and long apart evaluation methods. So, our mission is simple: promoting advances in individual lecturing by providing an interactive learning environment.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The Valit team is a dynamic group of 8 individuals with the shared goal of upgrading the status quo education evaluation process. The team consists of 5 frontend developers, who are responsible for developing the visually appealing, clean and user friendly web application. Two of these frontend developers were also instrumental in developing the UI/UX design, ensuring a seamless experience for users. The team also includes 3 highly skilled backend developers who work tirelessly to make sure the application runs smoothly and efficiently with data security in mind. Each member of the Valit team played an important role in the research and brainstorming phase, working together to iterate and bring the vision of our project to life. This collective effort is what makes the Valit team so unique and effective, with each member lending their own strengths and perspectives to the project.
