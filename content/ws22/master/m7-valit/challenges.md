{{<section title="Choose must have features" >}}
As meeting the requirements from both students and lecturers often contracted each other we worked on a feature set that encapsulated a common ground between the two. Therefore we carefully selected a stable base feature set and axed features like a Moodle course list import, as we deemed that to be too confusing.

{{<section title="Student login system" >}}
Another challenge was getting around the barrier of entry for students to fill out the questionnaires and participate in live feedback as well as evaluations. From that idea, we derived that no login and account system should be present for students. Instead we opted for easy access via a unique QR-Shortcode thatâ€™s presented by the lecturers themselves in the current lecturing session. Therefore student privacy was given whilst ensuring tampering security by making the code active only for the lessons duration and a few hours after.

{{<section title="User Experience" >}}
Refining the UI/UX part of the project also stood out to be of great importance. Whilst iterating and testing, we realized that translating features from the backlog to a final design often came with its own challenges, like how exactly to present data. For example showing short and important stats in one overview but also making written student feedback a priority. Presenting the live feedback to the lecturer in an unobtrusive way also took some time figuring out, with notifications and sounds being too distracting and an optional picture in picture overlay, that can be placed anywhere on the screen, being the middle ground.
