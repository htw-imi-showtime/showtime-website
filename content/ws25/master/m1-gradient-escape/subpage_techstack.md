* **Unity**

Unity (v. 6.2) is a cross-platform game engine that provides a wide range of game development resources, including assets, game objects, and C#. It supports both 2D and 3D game development and offers web builds, making it an excellent option for small projects due to its free usage policy.

* **GitHub**

GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, offering collaborative tools like pull requests, issues, code reviews and CI/CD integrations and is free for small teams. The code base for Gradient escape is stored on a private repo. Additionally we used GitHub Project to organize our ongoing tasks and divide them into branches.
