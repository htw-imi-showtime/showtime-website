{{<section title="Future Extensions">}}

In the future, the AR campus guide could be expanded with several new features to improve the overall user experience. One possible extension would be the integration of **sound effects**, making the exploration of the campus more immersive and engaging.

Another important step would be the use of **real location data**. At the moment, concrete campus locations are not yet available, so the guide currently works with pseudo locations. Once real location data is provided, it could be integrated to enable more accurate navigation between the different stations.

In addition, the project could be extended with **more interactive games** to further support playful learning. A **3D navigation system with guiding arrows** could also be added to visually lead users through the campus and make orientation even easier.
