{{<section title="Goal">}}
The goal of this project is to make research on sustainable food at HTW engaging and easy to explore for visitors. Using augmented reality, the campus guide allows users to discover the different sustainable food options, and experience the research in an interactive way. By combining elements with real locations, we want to make learning about sustainable food both fun and informative.

{{<section title="Process">}}


The development of our project started with an intensive research phase on the different real laboratories. To correctly integrate the results of the labs into the digital world, we continuously consulted with the experts from the food4future project. This exchange helped us create a reliable foundation for our guide.

Based on this foundation, we built our AR campus guide within a predefined framework. Our vision was to develop a navigation system that makes location based data on the campus engaging through gamification elements. In the first phase, we focused entirely on concept ideas and the design of both the website and the AR view, creating interactive games that present information in a playful and exciting way.

{{<section title="Outcome">}}

In the technical implementation phase, we divided the programming tasks among the team. In weekly meetings with our supervisor and the entire team, we presented our progress, discussed improvements, and continuously developed the application. The final outcome is a fully functional AR campus guide that allows visitors to explore food4future’s sustainable food options interactively and enjoyably, combining digital elements with real campus locations.

* **The Product**


Meet our guide, Nori! He will take you on a tour of the campus, sharing interesting facts and useful tips at every station.

The app includes interactive GPS navigation, which tracks your position in real time and leads you from one lab to the next across the campus. This makes the journey between stations part of the experience and ensures you see every stop in the campus.

* **Gamification Elements**

To enhance the learning experience, we have integrated an interactive quiz. Here, users can directly test their newly acquired knowledge about the real laboratories and receive playful feedback on their progress.

Support is available at any time for questions or challenges. At each station, information panels and image galleries explain the background of the real labs clearly and provide deeper insights into the research.

Another highlight is the interactive sliding puzzle, which invites users to engage with the images of the real laboratories in a playful way.

Our memory game presents the various sustainable dishes offered on campus. This allows users to better imagine the future menus and explore them interactively.
