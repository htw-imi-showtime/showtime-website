PlapperDu began with enthusiastic brainstorming and a flood of concepts. Initially, we aimed to map out everything perfectly, translating every idea into comprehensive UI prototypes, requirements and database models. However, we quickly realized that this waterfall approach was too time-consuming and inefficient, as constant changes made our detailed planning obsolete.


We shifted toward Agile development, adopting a build first, refine later strategy. Instead of over-planning, we focused on implementing core features like user authentication and standardized language assessments. This feedback-driven approach allowed us to iterate quickly and maintain constant alignment with our team and product owners.



Staying adaptable was key. We frequently reworked or discarded features to meet the product owners' vision while staying within the technical scope. This iterative process allowed us to refine the project according to real expectations.



In the final stage, we focused on app consistency and usability. By polishing the user interface and ensuring a unified design language, we created a seamless experience. Our goal was to ensure that parents can navigate the app intuitively, focusing on what matters most without any technical hurdles, which is their child's progress.

Currently, the learning modules are available in German and English. In the future, translating and implementing material in different mother tongues would increase the reach, allowing more families to benefit from these resources. 

Another aspect could be the expansion of additional learning modules and the introduction of more challenges, providing a wider variety of content to meet the specific needs of each child.
In addition, the webapp could see a future implementation of a search engine and an AI tool to help users with urgent questions. Another interesting feature could be an exchange platform for users to communicate and connect with one another.
