PlapperDu began with enthusiastic brainstorming and a flood of concepts. In the early stages, an extensive list of features was gathered, and the team familiarized themselves with the tools and frameworks required for implementation. 

However, the first major challenge soon emerged: defining the scope. With so many possibilities, it was difficult to pinpoint exactly what was essential and what was out of reach.

Initially, the goal was to map out everything perfectly from the start. A lot of time was spent translating every idea into comprehensive UI prototypes, requirements, and database models. It quickly became clear that this "Waterfall" approach was too time-consuming.

To overcome this, the strategy shifted toward agile development—a 'build first, refine later' approach. The focus moved to implementing core features like user authentication or standardized language assessments. Once a functional base was established, a feedback-driven approach was used to refine further progress.

This feedback-based approach ensured constant communication with the team and product owners to keep goals aligned. Being adaptable was very important to frequently rework and discard features to meet the product owners' vision while staying within the technical scope.

In the final stage, the focus was on consistency and usability to ensure that parents can navigate the app intuitively and focus on what matters without technical hurdles.

Currently, the learning modules are available in German and English. In the future, translating and implementing material in different mother tongues would increase the reach, allowing more families to benefit from these resources. 

Another aspect could be the expansion of additional learning modules and the introduction of more challenges, providing a wider variety of content to meet the specific needs of each child.
In addition, the webapp could see a future implementation of a search engine and an AI tool to help users with urgent questions. Another interesting feature could be an exchange platform for users to communicate and connect with one another.
