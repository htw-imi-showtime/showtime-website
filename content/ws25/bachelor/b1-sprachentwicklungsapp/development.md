The first stage of our process was focused on brainstorming. We brainstormed how to design the web app to be interactive and engaging, while familiarizing ourselves with various tools and frameworks required for the project. Our goal was to create a platform for parents to learn how to support their child's language development from the very beginning. Based on exisiting analog therapy methods, we identified key features: standardized texts to check a child's progress, learning modules for parents and weekly challenges to implement small, daily interactions.

In the second stage, we translated these ideas into UI prototypes, text content and database models. We quickly realized that trying to define every detail from the start was too time-consuming. To overcome this, we shifted our strategy. We began with basic code implementations for essential features like authentication and core language tests (e.g., SBE, FRAKIS). Our approach became feedback-based, following the motto of creating a first version to iterate upon later.

Throughout the development phase, we maintained constant communication with our team and product owners. This agile process was challenging, as we had to stay within scope while frequently adjusting or discarding features based on professional feedback. However, this allowed us to refine the project according to real expectations.

Our final stage was mainly focused on app consistency and polishing the user interface. We worked on ensuring that all modules followed a unified design language and that the naviagtion felt intuitive. By improving usability, we wanted to make sure that parents can easily access the learning contents and tests without technical hurdles, providing a seamless experience from start to finish.

During the entire development, we aimed to create a user experience that felt professional yet friendly and encouraging. We decided on a blue-themed palette with yellow accents to maintain a balance between a trustworthy, clinical feel and a warm, welcoming atmosphere for families.

One of our greatest challenges during the project was implementing and structuring our numerous ideas and thoughts within the scope. In the beginning, we had different strategies that had to prioritized and restructured over time. Through continuous coordination, clear prioritization and close teamwork, we worked through those challenges.

We provided the foundation for the most important steps in language development during the first three years of life. Our next steps are to provide material in different mother tongues to reach even more families. In addition, we will introduce stronger gamification modules to offer a deeper understanding of language, because language is more than just listening. With this project, we created a web app to test and assess current language abilities and to visually track improvements through milestones. In the future, we hope to reach more parents and people interested in early childhood language development, giving them more confidence and a positive influence on their child's progress.
