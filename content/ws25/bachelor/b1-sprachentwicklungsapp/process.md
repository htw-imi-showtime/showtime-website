The foundations and content of the application were developed in close cooperation with the clinical department for language development at Europe's leading university hospital. Based on existing analog counseling concepts, the entire process was transformed into a digital format by us.

In weekly meetings with the professional staff from the language development field, the state of development was discussed and reflected upon on a weekly basis. Additional internal group meetings took place to plan workflows and optimize the application, which were relevant for the further processes.

At the beginning of the development process, we dealt intensively with the subject matter to gain a deep understanding of the material and the underlying problems. With the help of brainstorming sessions in the early stages, we discussed the planning for the current form of our application with the clinical team and our supervisor.

The tasks were initially distributed equally and adjusted according to our indiviudal strengths and interests as the project progressed. Despite this specialization, all participants remained informed about all areas of the project and worked continously in a shared exchange.
