**Django**
We used Django as our server-side framework for managing core business logic, secure user authentication and ensuring data persistence.


**Vue.js**
For the frontend development, we utilized Vue.js to implement a reactive and interactive user interface.


**Nuxt.js**
Nuxt is a framework built on top of Vue.js. It provides built-in features such as automatic routing and server-side rendering (SSR), which allowed us to create a more efficient and seamless frontend.


**figma/ canva /Freeform**
For the design and user interface, we used Figma, Canva and Freeform. While Freeform provided a quick way to draft initial designs, we used Figma for the detailed UI and Canva for creating visual assets.


**Miro**
Miro initially served as our digital whiteboard for brainstorming, conceptual mapping and collecting new ideas during the early stages of the project.


**Pinia**
For consistent data flow across the application, we implemented Pinia as our state management tool. This ensured that all components remained synchronized.



**Communication & Collaboration**



**Gitlab, zoom, discord**
For managing tasks and staying in touch, we used GitLab for version control. Discord and Zoom we used for our meetings and daily updates, as well as quick communication and problem solving issues.
