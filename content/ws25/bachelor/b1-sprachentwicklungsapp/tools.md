* **Django**


We used Django as our server-side framework for managing core business logic, secure user authentication and ensuring reliable data persistence.



* **Vue.js**

For the frontend development, we utilized Vue.js to implement a reactive and interactive user interface.



* **Nuxt.js**

Nuxt is a framework built on top of Vue.js. It provides built-in features such as automatic routing and server-side rendering (SSR), which allowed us to create a more efficient and seamless frontend.

* **Pinia**

For consistent data flow across the application, we implemented Pinia as our state management tool. This ensured that all components remained synchronized.


* **Figma/ Canva/ Freeform**

For the design and user interface, we used Figma, Canva and Freeform. While Freeform provided a quick way to draft initial designs, we used Figma for the detailed UI and Canva for creating visual assets. 

* **Miro**

Miro initially served as our digital whiteboard for brainstorming, conceptual mapping and collecting new ideas during the early stages of the project. 




**Communication & Collaboration**

For managing tasks and staying in touch, we used GitLab for vesion control and Discord and Zoom for meetings and regular updates.
