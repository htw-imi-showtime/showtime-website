{{<section title="What is PlapperDu? ">}}

PlapperDu is supposed to help you navigate the experience of teaching your child to speak in the very early stage of language development. With the help of learning modules, weekly challenges and notifications, you will learn step by step small adjustments in your daily life and improvement.

{{<section title="Our motivation">}}
Speech and language disorders are among the most common developmental challenges in children, a trend that has intensified significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical diagnosis and treatment often do not begin until the age of three (36 months). However, the period between 24 and 36 months, also known as the "Watchful Waiting" phase, is a critical window for language development.
We aim to bridge this gap. Through interactive modules and gamified challenges, the app transforms everyday situations into playful learning opportunities (showing how simple adjustments in daily life can significantly improve speech development). Meanwhile, intergrated language assessments and a vocabulary tracker provide a clear overview of the child's language development. This ensures the 'Watchful Waiting' phase is no longer just about passing time, but a chance to actively support age-appropriate language development.

{{<section title="Process">}}

The foundations and content of the application were developed in close cooperation with the clinical department for language development at Europe's leading university hospital. Based on existing analog counseling concepts, the entire process was transformed into a digital format by us.

In weekly meetings with professional staff from the language development field, the state of development was discussed and reflected upon on a weekly basis. Additional internal group meetings took place to plan workflows and optimize the application, which were relevant for the further processes.

At the beginning of the development process, we dealt intensively with the subject matter to gain a deep understanding of the material and the underlying problems. With the help of brainstorming sessions in the early stages, we discussed the planning for the current form of our application with the clinical team and our supervisor.

We initially split the workload equally, but refined our roles over time to match our individual skill as the project progressed. Despite the different roles, we maintained a constant exchange to ensure that everyone remained fully informed about all areas of the project.
