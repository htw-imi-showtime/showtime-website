{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Language development disorders are one of the most common developmental disorders in children, with numbers increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. Language delays are often clinically diagnosed and treated starting at 36 months. The "Watchful Waiting" phase, which lasts from 24 to 36 months, is an overlooked period that is highly relevant for language development. Our goal is to close this gap, strengthen intuitive parental competence, and integrate prevention playfully into everyday family life.
