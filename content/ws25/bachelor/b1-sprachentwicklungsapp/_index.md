{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Language development disorders are among the most common developmental disorders in children, with numbers having risen significantly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Deficits are often clinically diagnosed and treated starting at 36 months. The "Watchful Waiting" phase, which lasts from 24 to 36 months, is an overlooked period that is highly relevant for language development. Our goal is to close this gap, strengthen intuitive parental competence, and integrate prevention playfully into everyday family life.
