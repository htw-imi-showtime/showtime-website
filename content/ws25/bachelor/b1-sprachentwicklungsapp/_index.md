{{<section title="Our Motivation">}}

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Language development disorders are one of the most common developmental disorders in children. Language delays are often clinically diagnosed and treated starting at 36 months. The "Watchful Waiting" phase, which lasts from 24 to 36 months, is an overlooked period that is highly relevant for language development. Our goal is to close this gap, strengthen intuitive parental competence, and integrate prevention playfully into everyday family life.

We aim to bridge this gap. Through interactive modules and gamified challenges, PlapperDu transforms everyday situations into playful learning opportunities. Meanwhile, integrated language assessments and a vocabulary tracker provide a clear overview of the child's language development. This ensures that the 'Watchful Waiting' phase is no longer just about passing time, but a chance to actively support age-appropriate language development.
