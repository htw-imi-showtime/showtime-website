* **Zoom Effect**

We have used different implementations to visualise this effect. In some scenes, the objects are scaled up while the camera stays static; in others, the camera moves forward as the objects keep in their position.

* **Transitions**

When one scene is finished, the game transforms you into a new one, creating an endless loop.

* **Gameplay**

In this game, the player starts with three lives. Colliding with an obstacle decreases half a heart from their health. The objective is to survive as long as possible to achieve the highest score, which increases based on the duration of survival.
