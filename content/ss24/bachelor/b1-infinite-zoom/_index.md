Dive into a journey with our infinite zoom 3D game. Navigate through obstacles, explore funky scenes and test your reflexes in a game that never ends. Each scene brings new thrills, pushing your skills to the limit in a universe that continuously evolves. 

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The main task of this project was to create a constant zoom effect in a 3D environment that evolves with time and never stops. We wanted to make this experience more engaging for the audience, so we implemented a game mode where the users must avoid the obstacles that come in their way. 

 Our aim is to develop a game that not only entertains but also inspires players to explore the infinite possibilities of a dynamic 3D world.
