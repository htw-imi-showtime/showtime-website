{{<section title="Process">}}

Our development process is agile and iterative, allowing us to adapt quickly to new ideas and feedback. We start with brainstorming where all team members contribute their ideas for game mechanics, visual elements, and obstacles. Once we have a clear concept, we move into prototyping, where we create basic versions of the game to test and refine.
