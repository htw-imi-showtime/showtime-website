* **Completely Updated Codebase**

The original PAM was written in Springboot/Vaadin. The new PAM is written in React/Typescript, with usage of Figma for the design amongst other tools.
Of course, this meant re-working the Tool from the ground-up in order to get all the old features working, before adding new features down the line.

* **New Design**

The original PAM was not as appealing to the eye as it could be. The colors had little to do with GlobalCT who owned the Tool, the front screen just had a flat "Log in via Microsoft" button right in the center of the screen...needless to say, it needed a modern overhaul.
The new PAM is designed with GlobalCT's colors in mind, uses a more fluid and rounded design in order to be more visually appealing to look at without being too distracting, and uses a more reactive interface to actually make you able to see what you are interacting with.
The design also scales with the size of the screen to avoid getting "sandwiched" in smaller displays. 
Even the UI for the integrated BMPN.io was reworked to be more easy on the eyes.

* **Sorting Function**

You can now organize the diagrams you've made with PAM by Name, Date and Name of the Author. You can also sort by their Status: Published, Unpublished and In-Progress.

* **Export Function**

Users of PAM can now export their Diagrams in different formats. PDF, XML and .SVG are all possibilities now.
