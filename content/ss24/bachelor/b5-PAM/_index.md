The Tool's purpose is to allow for the simple creation of Process Diagrams using a simple interface, as well the saving and exporting of those diagrams in various formats as required, organizing them depending on the preferences of the creators by allowing for a custom repository structure of folders and sub-folders.
It also has an internal organization scheme following a simple folder/file format. However, it was rather simple, focusing on the basic features initially. That's where we came in.

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The Goal of this project was to improve and update PAM to use certain features as requested by GlobalCT, as well as learn to work within the Agile Development Project Structure. 
The base PAM lacked quite a few features and had a very outdated design, so the focus was to provide a new front-end as well as providing basic features from other organisational programs to improve the overall Structure of the program.
