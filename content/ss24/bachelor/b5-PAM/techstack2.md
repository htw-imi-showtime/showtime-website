{{<section title="Future">}}

As this is a project on a limited-time basis, we are not planning on adding new features. However, we are going to add enough comments and documentation so that the next group to pick it up and try to improve on it will have an easier time. Future improvements to PAM would include Syntax Investigation of the diagrams, more in-depth filtering, perhaps even a social media share function. We ended up creating a solid base program that can allow for future improvements by the next group to work on it as we pass them the torch.

As for our personal futures, we plan on taking the skills we developed in this project and perhaps improving on them in our repertoire to use in our future jobs and prospects.

{{<section title="Personal Reflections">}}

Lukas Oswald: While the project was initially off to a rocky start due the new language we had to learn and the fact that we had to organize ourselves, we took our time and quickly managed to settle into roles we were comfortable with. Everyone quickly learned how to use their strengths to provide valuable updates and upgrades to the program, as well as the general working atmosphere, and it definitely helped us all become a more close-knit group as well.
Each of us managed to find a way to implement our respective strengths into the project, and used them to support each other in various ways to create a project we can honestly be proud of. I was initially a bit nervous about my role in the project, but once I found out how valuable the organization was and how much it helped everyone, I took to it with gusto and was proud of all the ways I helped people with preparation as well as learning even further how to improve my own presentation skills as well as my organization skills.
I'd definitely say the project was an overall success, and we all learned a lot about the Scrum Methodology and Agile Development, as well as learning more about the code and working a programming project. It was definitely a peek into our future if we ever have to work in a similar environment, but all in all, I felt it was a very relaxed and friendly environment. The Supervisors from GlobalGT were immensely helpful, and made us feel like we were part of the company, as well as helping with any questions we had, or worries we had throughout the project.
I would say I learned quite a bit, and I'm looking forward to seeing how people take to our project.

Margarita Boiko: I am immensely grateful for this project. I discovered my strengths and also understood what I need to work on, both professionally and personally. For the first time, I created a design from scratch, learned React, practiced SCSS more, and learned a lot about Scrum management.

Anh Phuc-Hoang: Participating in the PAM project for SS2024 has been a great and comprehensive experience for us students. From being newbies in web programming in the early days, we now feel confident in taking on similar tasks. With the dedicated help of the supervisors at GlobalCT, we have learned a lot—not only about web programming but also about teamwork (SCRUM), problem-solving skills, and, importantly, professional presentation skills. These valuable skills will undoubtedly benefit us in the long run.
Additionally, the fun and comfortable moments in meetings and lunches are unforgettable. Perhaps this is the catalyst that makes us, the newbies, work productively and effectively (we have completed 95% of the backlog - I'm not lying ^^).
In short, I am very grateful to be a member of the PAM project in SS2024.

Hamzeh Hamzeh: The project PAM was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to work in a team by using agile working ways, how and when to communicate with team members to ensure a smooth workflow and I learned a lot about web development. How to use react and some parts of spring boot. I learned about implementing an API.
We had some challenges at first with our teamwork regarding which technologies, structure and dividing the tasks among us, but sprint after sprint we learned how to decide together on what to use and how to do things. I am very happy about that. I feel like we had very good team synergy once we learned how to work together.
Regarding the project itself I sometimes wished we would’ve had a brand-new project which we did from scratch. Our project already had a backend. We were supposed to create a new frontend for it and we ended up extending the backend. Although it is more fun to do the backend from scratch, I think in the real world I will be working on projects I didn't create myself, so it was good practice to work with someone else's code. The code of the backend wasn't ideal. The structure wasn't the best, and it took me a bit to understand it because it wasn't clean code. I had the option to refactor it, but considering the time we had and the fact that it was working, I decided not to touch it and just extend it the way it was. I would’ve enjoyed refactoring it, but it would have taken a lot of time.
I also felt like we had very good supervisors. Dr. Sue-Ann Bäsler did a very good job explaining to us how to work in a scrum team and all the aspects of sprints like review, retrospective and planning. Vu Minh Le helped us with technical challenges and sent us in the right direction when we had a problem to solve.
So overall I'd say I learned a lot during this project, and I’m happy with the outcome, the teamwork and all the knowledge I acquired.
