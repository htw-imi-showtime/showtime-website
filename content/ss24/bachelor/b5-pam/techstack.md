{{<section title="Future">}}

As this is a project on a limited-time basis, we are not planning on adding new features. However, we are going to add enough comments and documentation so that the next group to pick it up and try to improve on it will have an easier time. Future improvements to PAM would include Syntax Investigation of the diagrams, more in-depth filtering, perhaps even a social media share function. We ended up creating a solid base program that can allow for future improvements by the next group to work on it as we pass them the torch.

As for our personal futures, we plan on taking the skills we developed in this project and perhaps improving on them in our repertoire to use in our future jobs and prospects.
