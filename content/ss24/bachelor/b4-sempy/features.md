Our SEMPY Button offers a relaxed shopping experience that provides customers with recommendations based on the information from the three major platforms: idealo, Amazon, and YouTube. Whether the customer is interested in products like a "Victorinox Huntsman", an "MSR Hubba Hubba 2 NX", or "Apple AirPods 3", the SEMPY-AI Tool caters to the customer's individual needs.

We take information from idealo, YouTube and Amazon and give them to the OpenAi to process and summarize them. It then generates a text with all the important information in an overview with pros and cons, a short summary of customer reviews, a review video, FAQ's and a recommendation of a target audience.
