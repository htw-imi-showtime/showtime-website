{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has advanced significantly, and today many people use technologies such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Google's TensorFlow, and IBM Watson because these tools make life easier. Our goal is to simplify the user experience on idealo, helping with purchasing decisions and saving time during researching for a product. Our SEMPY research aims to gather the most important product data and customer opinions in one place, avoiding the need to search on different platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Google.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
Team SEMPY consists of us five young IMI students **S**on, **E**ldar, **M**athieu, **P**aul and **Y**asin (SEMPY) who came together to build this project. None of us had experience working with the OpenAI API, so it was quite a challenge for us. Through this project, we gained a lot of knowledge about working with AI and by supporting each other during the development.
