{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has advanced significantly, and today many people use technologies such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Google's TensorFlow, and IBM Watson because these tools make life easier. Our goal is to simplify the lives of customers on idealo, helping them with their purchasing decisions and saving them a lot of time. We aim to leverage this technology to enhance the customer experience on the idealo site. Our SEMPY research aims to gather the most important product data and customer opinions in one place, avoiding the need to search on different platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, and Google.

{{<section title="The team">}}
The SEMPY team consists of five young IMI students who came together to build this project. None of us had experience working with the OpenAI API, so it was quite a challenge for us. Through this project, we gained a lot of knowledge about working with AI and learned a lot by supporting each other during the development.
