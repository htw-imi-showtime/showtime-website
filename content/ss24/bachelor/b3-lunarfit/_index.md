{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Approximately 85% of women experience menstrual-related complaints.
Even though it commonly interferes with everyday life, the menstrual cycle is often ignored or even tabooed.
Especially in sports, learning about their cycle, helps athletes mitigate complaints. Adapting the training accordingly allows them to harness long-term performance benefits.
Education and awareness are crucial to end stigmatization and empower female athletes.

{{<section title="Features">}}
Lunarfit aims to bridge the gap between menstrual health and athletic performance.
Therefore, a core component is the daily assessment, that combines training data, individual well-being and a range of methods to track the menstrual cycle accurately.
Based on this it is possible to offer personalized nutritional and training recommendations.
A calendar view facilitates long term planning.
Information screens helps to better understand the menstrual cycle. 
All of this allows to make more informed decisions and communicate better with trainers and peers.

{{<section title="Process">}}
The foundation of our project was provided by the Institute of Sports Science at the University of Bern, giving us a scientific basis to build upon. They initially presented their idea using a Miro Board, setting the stage for our development process. As we progressed, we continuously refined and expanded the concept, ensuring it evolved effectively throughout the project.

Before officially starting, we conducted a market analysis to assess the landscape and understand user requirements. Using the insights gained, we defined a set of features and created database and API schemas and clickable mockups in Figma to visualize the app's functionality.

Next, we evaluated different tech stacks to identify the one that would best support our ideas. We then employed an agile development process, holding weekly meetings to maintain flexibility and respond to feedback quickly. This iterative approach allowed us to continuously optimize our ideas, ensuring it was both functional and user-friendly.

{{<section title="Team">}}
Each team member was assigned a specific part of the app to focus on, promoting a sense of responsibility. This division of labor streamlined the development process and ensured that all aspects of the app received the necessary attention.
