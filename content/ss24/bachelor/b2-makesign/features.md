Using Makesign, you can project your own pictures, posters and GIFs on a screen and manage your content with an easy-to-use interface at any time.
Create slideshows, choosing how long each of the images are being displayed. 
For dynamic displays, such as the dashboard, where you can see what tool is booked for how long, you can simply create a website and connect it with the system.
The projection runs via a Raspberry Pi, which means you can connect them to basically any screen you have lying around and give them a new life.
