At the beginning of the project, we discussed about what exactly we wanted to achieve and therefore did some brainstorming. In addition, each of us sketched wireframes to find the necessary functions and the design we need. We looked at the IdiA Booking website and selected the most important data, so we could add any missing information or features. After agreeing that our implementation should use the API of the IdiA Booking website and also project images and/or videos, we began researching for possible solutions. We researched which hardware, software, and frameworks we could use and came across RaspberryPi minicomputers. RaspberryPi as hardware enabled us to run our software permanently, as the performance is sufficient for our software. We also looked around the campus for existing digital signages to use as inspiration for our idea. Then we divided the tasks to work on setting up an Operating System on the Raspberry Pi and to look for software solutions. We researched open-source solutions to change the content on the digital signage and finally came across Concerto. Problems arose here because Concerto was written in the programming language "Ruby on Rails", so we had to learn a new programming language and try to understand it. Also, the last update was 7 years ago, so it was necessary to renew and improve Concerto. Our supervisor supported us in this process, as it was difficult to improve the code without much "Ruby on Rails" knowledge. Later on we managed to run Linux on the RaspberryPi and connect it to the internet. In the same time we got access to the API of the IdiA booking system and managed to use and understand it. Over the weeks, we had weekly meetings and met several times a week to work on the project. In the following weeks we were able to configure our RaspberryPi as good as possible, so it could run and project a website on a monitor. Gradually, we were able to improve Concerto's code and combine it with a website which uses the API from IdiA. In the last weeks we build and integrated a system which gives the user of our app the possibility to change the projected posters and videos.
