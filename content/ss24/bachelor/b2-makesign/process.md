At the beginning of the project, we dealt with what exactly we wanted to achieve and therefore did some brainstorming. In addition, each of us sketched wireframes to create the necessary functions and a design. We looked at the IdiA Booking website and selected the most important data. After agreeing that our implementation should use the API of the IdiA Booking website and also project images and/or videos, we began researching possible solutions. We researched which hardware, software, and frameworks we could and wanted to use and came across Raspberry Pi minicomputers. Raspberry Pis enabled us to run our software permanently, as the performance of model 5 is sufficient for our software. We also looked around the campus for existing digital signages to use as inspiration for our idea. Then we divided the tasks to work on setting up an OS on the Raspberry Pi and to look for software solutions. We researched open-source solutions to change the content on the digital signage and finally came across "Concerto". Problems arose here because Concerto was written in Ruby on Rails and we had to learn a new programming language and try to understand it. Also, the last update was 7 years ago, so it was necessary to renew and improve Concerto. Our supervisor supported us in this process, as it was difficult to improve the code without any Ruby on Rails knowledge. Over the weeks, we had weekly meetings and met several times a week to work on the project. Gradually, we were able to improve Concerto's code and manage to create our own website that could project a screen using Concerto. Besides, from previous research, we used "Bootstrap" as a framework for the style of the website.
