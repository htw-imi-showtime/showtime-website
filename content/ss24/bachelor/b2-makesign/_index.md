{{<section title="Overview">}}

In collaboration with [IDiA](https://entrepreneurship.htw-berlin.de/ueber-uns/ideas-in-action-idia/ueber-idia/), we developed a project that aims to create a digital signage solution for the [Makerspace](https://entrepreneurship.htw-berlin.de/ueber-uns/ideas-in-action-idia/idia-spaces/maker-space/).
MakeSign will be used to display adverts and reservations for tools.

Key features include a well-structured dashboard for displaying time slots of 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC machines, as well as a system for uploading images to be displayed on monitors using micro computers.
