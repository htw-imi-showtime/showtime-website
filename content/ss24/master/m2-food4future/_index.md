{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
This project is about science and how you can save the world. How, you ask? Imagine a scenario where the area available for food production is decreasing. You are part of a team responsible for the indoor cultivation of algae. Those can be used to produce food. Your task is to optimise the production for these algae and feed your country. Take a deep dive in the sience of algae and the related productoin process. Explore all three research steps in an Augmented Reality environment anywhere you want. Anywhere? Yes! You can use a smartphone or a tablet to enjoy the immersive experience. Our goal is to bring the sience into the home of many. With our AR-Adventure you can play with parameters based on real world data to care about your algae and optimise their production.
