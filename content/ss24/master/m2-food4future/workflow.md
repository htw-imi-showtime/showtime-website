{{<section title="Workflow">}}
As we are working in a group of four, we must use git (githHub) as our Version Control System. As our game engine we choose Unity, because it should be easier to work with as a beginner. To create the 3D-Models we used Blender and the build-in solutions provided by Unity itself.
As our app only deploys on Android yet, we also used smartphones and tablets to test the application.<br> <br>
Other than that, we met every week on Tuesdays at HTW and Fridays (or Sundays) via Zoom. In the last weeks before the IMI_Showtime we additionally met during other days in the week.
