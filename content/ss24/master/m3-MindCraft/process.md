As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles on the topic of **cognitive skills** and how they can be tested to get an idea of what coginitive skills there are and how they could be measured. We also looked at other games on the market who already try to help with enhancing cognitive abilities to find out **what we could do better**.
Simultaneously we already collected ideas for **possible minigames** we could implement to help **enhance specific cognitive skills** and researched possibilities to **motivate our users to keep training**. To collect and review the results of our research in a single space we gathered our findings in a miro board.
To finalize our research we conducted an **expert interview with a psychologist from Freie Universit√§t Berlin**. This way we could ensure what we do will actually make sense from a **psychological perspective**.

{{<section title ="Concept" >}} 
After we had done all the research and collected all the ideas, we started to work on the concept of our game suite. During this process, we looked at different possibilities on which tech stack we should use and for what platform we should build the project. Considering that the game suite should be available for everyone while making it as easy as possible for patients to get started, we decided on aiming for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. Due to our previous experience with the engine, we ultimatively decided to develop the game with the open-source Godot Engine.
During the concept phase we also picked which minigames we want to implement and started planning the game world and the overall design of the game using a moodboard and user stories.

{{<section title ="Design" >}} 
While already developing the first minigames and setting up the backend, we started creating the designs. It was important to us to make the users **feel comfortable and at home** while using the game suite. 

To achieve this we decided to go with a **clean and simple design** that is easy to understand and navigate. We also wanted to make sure that the design is **colorful and engaging** to keep the users motivated to keep training. We also made sure to use a **warm and friendly color palette** to make the users feel welcome and comfortable.

{{<section title ="Implementation" >}}
After we had finished the concept and design phase, we started implementing the game suite. To coordinate and keep track of our work, we created a **Kanban board**. This way everyone could see what the others were working on and what still needed to be done. We also had **regular meetings** to discuss the progress and to help each other with problems we encountered.
