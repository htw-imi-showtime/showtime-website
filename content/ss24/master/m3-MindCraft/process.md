As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles on the topic of **cognitive skills** and how they can be tested to get an idea of what coginitive skills there are and how they could be measured. We also performed a **market analysis** to see what existing games with a smiliar focus are out there and what we could learn from them.
Simultaneously we already collected ideas for **possible minigames** we could implement to help **enhance specific cognitive skills** and researched possibilities to **motivate our users to keep training**. To collect and review the results of our research in a single space we gathered our findings in a miro board.
To finalize our research we conducted an **expert interview with a psychologist from Freie Universität Berlin**. This way we could ensure our solution will actually make sense from a **psychological perspective**. Basing our game suite on **actual scientific findings** is what differentiates our project from other similiar games.

{{<section title ="Concept" >}} 
After we had done all the research and collected all the ideas, we started to work on the **concept of our game suite**. During this process, we looked at different possibilities on **which tech stack** we should use and for **what platform** we should build the project. Considering that the game suite **should be available for everyone** while making it as easy as possible for patients to get started, we decided on aiming for **mobile devices** like tablets and smartphones. Due to our previous experience with the engine, we ultimatively decided to develop the game with the **open-source Godot Engine**.
During the concept phase we also picked which minigames we want to implement and started planning the game world and the overall design of the game using a **moodboard** and **user stories**.
We devided the cognitive skills into **five categories** (Logical Thinking, Working Memory, Spatial Thinking, Attention and Reaction Speed) and decided that our **minimum viable product** should include at least one minigame for each category.

{{<section title ="Design" >}} 
While already developing the first minigames and setting up the backend, we started creating the designs. It was important to us that our game suite would be appealing for our **target group**: Adolescents and young adults between the ages of 13 and 30 who either suffer from chronic physical illnesses and spend a lot of time in hospital or who are at risk of suffering cognitive impairment. 

To achieve this we decided to go with a clean and simple design that feels **warm and welcoming**. We also wanted to make sure that the design is **colorful and engaging** to keep the users motivated to keep training. We also made sure to use a **warm and friendly color palette** to make the users feel welcome and comfortable.

{{<section title ="Implementation" >}}
After we had finished the concept and design phase, we started implementing the game suite. To coordinate and keep track of our work, we used the **Kanban board** we created right at the beginning of the project. This way everyone could see what the others were working on and what still needed to be done. We also had **regular meetings** to discuss the progress and to help each other with problems we encountered.
