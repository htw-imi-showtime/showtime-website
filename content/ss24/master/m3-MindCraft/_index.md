{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Mental disorders can significantly impact **cognitive abilities**, making daily tasks and therapy more challenging. We believe that interactive and adaptive activities can help **improve** these cognitive functions. However, there is a lack of personalized and engaging tools designed **specifically for this purpose**.

That's where our **game suite** comes in: developed in collaboration with psychologists from **Freie Universität Berlin**, our application is designed for individuals undergoing therapy for mental disorders. **CogniCity** provides engaging, adaptive **cognitive challenges** that integrate seamlessly into existing therapeutic practices. By involving patients in **fun and interactive minigames**, the game suite aims to **enhance cognitive abilities** and motivation, leading to more effective and enjoyable therapy sessions.

Together, patients and therapists can work towards better mental health and **improved cognitive functions**, creating a supportive and engaging therapeutic environment.

{{<section title="The team">}}
The team constists of five students with **different interests and skillsets**. While some of us already brought a fair amount of experience in the field of game development, others were relatively new to the field. To achieve the best results in the limited time, we initially splitted the work into three categories:

- Game Design & UI/UX
- Game Development
- Backend Development

All of us participated in a long initial conceptual period within the first four weeks, followed by a couple of weeks where everyone worked on tasks within the categories that suited their skillset the best. At the end though, everyone worked **wherever there was work to be done**. This way everyone could **gather experience in new areas** and learn a lot during the project.
