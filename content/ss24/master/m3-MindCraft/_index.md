{{<section title="The Problem">}}
How good our **cognitive abilities** are has a **significant impact** on how good we perceive our own **life quality**.<sup>1</sup> 

Unfortunately some health conditions and their treatments can lead to a **decline in these abilities**. For example, imagine a teenager who has to spend a lot of time in the hospital due to a **chronic illness** and is unable to attend school regularly. Or a young adult who suffers from a heart disease and has to take regular **medication which can affect their cognitive abilities**. 

To fight the potential decline in those abilities, it is important to **train them regularly**. However, the training should be **fun and engaging** to keep the motivation high. This is where **CogniCity** comes in: a **game suite** that provides **interactive and adaptive minigames** to help improve cognitive abilities in a fun and engaging way.

{{<section title="The Solution">}}
Embedded in a research project of the **Freie Universität Berlin**, we aim to develop a **game suite** that is specifically designed to support individuals who are **in danger of cognitive decline** due to health conditions or their treatments. Our goal is to provide a **fun and engaging** way to train cognitive abilities, while also keeping track of the progress made. **CogniCity** provides a **variety of minigames** that can be used to train different cognitive abilities, such as **logical thinking**, **working memory** or **spatial thinking**.

{{<section title="The team">}}
While the core of the team consists of five HTW students, experts at the **Freie Universität Berlin** supported the project by answering our **psychological and mathematical questions**. This way we were able to create a **scientifically based solution**. 

To make use of the different skill sets in our group, we split the work into three categories:

- Game Design & UI/UX
- Game Development
- Backend Development

We used an **agile workflow** and assigned new tasks **dynamically** to ensure an **efficient development process**.
