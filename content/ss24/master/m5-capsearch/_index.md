In large-scale companies with numerous employees, identifying the ideal project that fosters professional growth and aligns perfectly with individual expectations has consistently posed a challenge. Even after discovering a suitable project, the conventional back-and-forth email exchanges for sharing general information can prove time consuming and labor intensive for both employees and managers.

{{<section title="Process">}}
Focusing on a quality product in the end, agile principles were always a part of the development process.
After the requirements and scope of the project had been defined, the tasks were divided within the development team in such a way that the personal skill set of each individual could be brought out and used, but also offered opportunities to learn something new together and support each other.
the results were then presented in weekly sprints where concerns could be clarified and new ideas could be given and received in order to produce a satisfactory product.
