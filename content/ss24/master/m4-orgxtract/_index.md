{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The project aims to **transform organizational charts**, traditionally stored as PDFs, into a machine-readable format to enhance transparency in German authorities personnel structure. It focuses on converting these static documents into data that can be easily analyzed, to provide deeper insights into public administration.
The goal was to create a tool for the Open Knowledge Foundation team to extract data from organizational charts of public authorities in PDF and use the output data to conduct their research.
