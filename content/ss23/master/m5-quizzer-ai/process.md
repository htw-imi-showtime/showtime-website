In our project, we managed the process using a **Trello** board, a helpful tool for organizing tasks and responsibilities. The Kanban board allowed us to efficiently distribute tasks among the team members and track the progress of each assignment. This method facilitated clear communication and coordination throughout the project, ensuring that everyone knew their roles and deadlines.
