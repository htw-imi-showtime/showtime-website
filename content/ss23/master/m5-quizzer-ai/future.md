{{<section title="ðŸ§Š bloc integration">}}

We're planning to expand our Flutter application by integrating **Bloc** for state management. **Bloc** will provide us with a more structured approach to handle state, making our codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

{{<section title="new models">}}

As of now, the currently available models for FineTuning from OpenAI will be deprecated and no longer accessible in the near future. Instead, new models like **gpt-3.5-turbo** or **gpt-4** will be made available. With the introduction of these new models, there may be changes in the procedures, and Quizzer will need to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate these changes.
