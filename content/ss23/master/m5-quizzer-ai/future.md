{{<section title="🧊 bloc integration">}}

We're planning to expand our Flutter application by integrating **Bloc** for state management. **Bloc** will provide us with a more structured approach to handle state, making our codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

{{<section title="🤖 future models">}}

As of now, the only currently available models for fine-tuning from OpenAI will be deprecated and no longer accessible in the near future. Instead, new models like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 will be made available for fine-tuning in the upcoming months. With the introduction of these new models, there may be changes in the procedures, and Quizzer will need to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate these changes.

{{<section title="ℹ️ support">}}

We realized the main requirements of the project tender and contributed our own features and ideas in the process. Handing the project over to Mobile Learning Labs again means that we will act as consultants and supporters should questions and difficulties arise in the future.
