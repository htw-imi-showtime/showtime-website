{{<section title="🎯 Goal">}}
The primary objective of our project was to enhance and expand a small prototype for generating quiz questions using OpenAI and make it ready for release. The aim was to provide clients with an easier way to create quiz questions. To achieve this, we utilized Fine-Tuning and Embeddings. Users can import their specific knowledge or create their custom models to improve the question format.
