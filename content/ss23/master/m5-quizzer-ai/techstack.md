The project was built upon an existing prototype, reducing the need for starting from scratch. **Flutter**, a Google-developed open-source framework for cross-platform app development, was chosen for the UI. It utilizes **Dart**, a programming language tightly integrated with **Flutter**. The **Isar** database is a robust **Flutter** package that seamlessly integrates databases. It offers fast performance, supports various data types, and facilitates efficient data filtering. Additionally, it optimizes offline usage and benefits from a strong community support, making it a reliable data management solution for **Flutter** applications.

For the generation of quiz questions, we use the OpenAI API and utilize its powerful models such as **GPT-3.5-Turbo** and even **GPT-4**. In addition to the typical prompts used in ChatGPT, we have the flexibility to pass additional parameters to further refine the desired answers and improve the overall quality of the generated quiz questions.

Since the development environment was already available, we followed these guidelines and used **Andriod Studio**, which is perfectly suited for the development of Flutter. Also **BitBucket** was already predefined. This was a small challenge, since the experience was limited to GitHub and GitLab. **Trello** was helpful in distributing tasks and making it easier to keep track of the project's progress.

On this project, we used **Discord** and **Microsoft Teams** to stay connected. **Microsoft Teams** facilitated weekly meetings and project management, while **Discord** kept us in constant communication.
