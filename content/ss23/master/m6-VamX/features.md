To monitor heart rate, which is a measure of stress, we have integrated a Bluetooth interface into the framework. A paired heart rate device passes on its measured data to VamX. The course of the heart rate is displayed as a graph in the framework in real time.
{{<image src="device.png" alt="Alt text" caption="VamX and heart rate measuring instrument are connected via bluetooth.">}}
For testing the framework we have developed three VR games. Based on their different characteristics, various predictions and scenarios are to be drawn for one's own application. The games have the soundscape preconfigured by VamX, so that everything can be tried out immediately.
