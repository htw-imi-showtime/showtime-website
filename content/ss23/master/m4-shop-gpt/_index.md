{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
At present, one of the primary challenges faced by idealo users revolves around the **overwhelming number of filters**, as well as an **extensive list of products** on the main website. This can significantly prolong the process of searching for a specific product, demanding an unnecessary substantial amount of time from users. 
The key objective of our project, therefore, is to **effectively address this issue** and build a powerful shopping assistant to **simplify the shopping process**.

Using the latest AI technology, we let users have the flexibility to choose their way to communicate with the assistant, through text or image. We aspire to optimize the decision-making process by offering valuable advice, and recommendations. Most importantly, we hope that our innovative features will make shopping on idealo more intuitive, fun, and seamless for our users.
