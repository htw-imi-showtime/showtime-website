{{<section title="Multiple Images Uploaded" >}}
It is intended that ShopGPT will support the ability to upload multiple images in the future. This will enable users to provide more detailed visual information about the products they are seeking, allowing for even more accurate and tailored recommendations.

{{<section title="Combination of Text and Image Input" >}}
Currently, the user can either text or upload an image. We want to work towards seamlessly integrating both text and image input simultaneously within ShopGPT. This means users will have the flexibility to describe their desired products through text and supplement it with visual references, enabling a richer and more comprehensive shopping experience.

{{<section title="Quality Improvement" >}}
One of the most important future goals is to improve the performance of ShopGPT, ensuring faster response times and a smoother user experience. We also want to advance our image recognition capabilities to provide even more accurate and precise results by fine-tuning the image embedding model based on the idealo database. Additionally, we aim to offer responses more precisely in any user's preferred language, catering to a more diverse user base. Inclusive design is also a key focus, ensuring that ShopGPT is accessible and user-friendly for everyone.
