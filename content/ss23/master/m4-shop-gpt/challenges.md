{{<section title="New AI Technologies" >}}
Using cutting-edge AI technologies presented us with significant challenges.
It required considerable time and effort to thoroughly research Prompt Engineering, GPT models,
LangChain framework and grasp these concepts, ensuring a solid understanding for effective
integration into our project.

{{<section title="Keeping Up with Rapid Technology Changes" >}}
As technology rapidly evolves, we encountered challenges in staying up-to-date with frequent
updates in LangChain versions, OpenAI function calls, GPT models, and Vector Database.
This necessitated continuous monitoring and adaptation to ensure compatibility.

{{<section title="Accessing idealo's Database" >}}
The process of gaining access to idealo's database and API was not as fast as we expected,
which did impact the early stages of development. Despite the delays, we persevered and
established effective communication to overcome this obstacle.

{{<section title="Image Similarity Search with Vector Database" >}}
Developing an image similarity search with Vector DB posed a significant challenge for us
due to limited time and various methods considered to retrieve similar images from the database.
Creating custom scripts to retrieve extensive product metadata and embedding data effectively
in our vector database introduced additional complexities.

{{<section title="Deployment Hurdles" >}}
Although we considered deploying our website, we encountered security concerns and limitations.
Due to security concerns and the early version prototype status of Idealo, we couldn't expose
the OpenSearch API key for deployment. Additionally, we needed to ensure cost-effectiveness and
prevent potential misuse by users. As a result, we made the decision not to proceed with deployment at this time.
