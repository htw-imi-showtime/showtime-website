* **Game-Modes**

The game is divided into two segments. A single player mode where each of our simple games can be played separately from others. 

In the endless mode where you can play until you run out of hearts. In this mode two randomly selected games of matching genres are displayed in parallel, on the right and left side respectively, and can be played simultaneously.

* **Game Genres**

During our research and preparation for the project, we discovered four types of attention, which we used to define our game genres: 
+ Reaction, games that test your reflexes; 
+ Memory, (obviously) tests your memory (duh!:); 
+ Cognition, tests your ability to deduce information; 
+ Rhythm, tests your feel for the beat.

By being virtually from different genres and requiring different kinds of attention, played in parallel they do require a certain amount of skills and a lots of concentration. With each additional game added to the roster, the chances for unexpected combinations and thus new challenge-ground for the mind arises.

* **Difficulty System**

Our games have three different levels. These can be set in advance in the options, or you start with the easiest and work your way up by passing some levels.

There are the classic modes easy, medium and hard, but also a new one we named varying. Varying means that, the difficulty is upgraded dynamically, the better the player is, and if you fail too often the difficulty is downgraded.

* **Scores and Times**

What great game can do without high-scores, collecting points and a pressuring timer? Exactely! That´s why we have them, too. 

But we used them for "scientific reasons". ;) <br>
The points incentivise you to to stay engaged in playful testing of your concentration, while the high-scores indirectly show your progression and betterment of concentration, by constantly reaching higher values. The timer is a dreading sight at the beginning, but a great measuring Tools for your brain's endurance in the end.
