To start with, we first had to define what a mini-game looks like. As we were able to determine, it was not so easy to commit to the necessary functions. We decided to look at the mini-games as a whole and to view our mini-games as individual tasks of a gaming experience.

By implementing simple functions such as pressing a button or moving the control stick in one direction, every gamer's heart is addressed.

After we had determined the direction of the game, we collected our ideas and recorded them on "miro" with the help of mind maps. We divided the types of games into 4 different categories: Skill, Cognitive, Memory and Reaction.
In order to create a balanced gaming experience, we adapted the mini-games to the four different categories and divided them accordingly.

After collecting the game ideas and dividing the mini-games into four categories, we started developing the games.
Since some already had experience with Unity, the first prototypes were built to illustrate. The group members with less experience first familiarized themselves with the development environment and initially built small test objects.

After we all got used to it, the games were implemented one after the other and simultaneously with everyone participating. A framework was created to structure the project. We also used this framework to regulate basic functions such as starting and pausing the entire game.
