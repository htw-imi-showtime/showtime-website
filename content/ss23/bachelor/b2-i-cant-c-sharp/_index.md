{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Our goal is to challenge and by that promote concentration.

Parallel mini-games in the areas of memory, reaction, cognition and rhythm are designed to challenge the player at different levels of difficulty.

The mini-games are deliberately designed to simulate the simplest tasks in combination.

It sounds easier than it is, so come to our booth and test it and your concentration yourself.
