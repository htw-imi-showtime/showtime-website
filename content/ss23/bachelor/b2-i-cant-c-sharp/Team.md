{{<section title="The team">}}
We are a striving group of IMI students, gathered together for the IMI Showtime project to create a wonderful experience for everyone joining our fair booth. Many of us are very creative minds, artistically versatile yet specialists in their respective fields and (semi-)experienced, good game designers. Hence we decided to do the game related project.
