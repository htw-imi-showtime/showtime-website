{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
If you’ve ever used a VR Headset, you might’ve run into the tedious task of inputting text. This experience is quite similar to navigating a keyboard with the remote of your smart-TV. A viable alternative which can often be seen on a smart-TV’s is some form of Speech-To-Text. 
We then asked ourselves which STT Api’s are there, and how do we implement them into Unity? After all, what better way is there to introduce a feature than by gamifying it.
…
Our game should offer the possibility to try out different STT-API's while enabling an easy solution to connect further API's from various providers.

{{<section title="Introduction">}}

Once started, you have to choose one of the implemented STT-API’s. 

After that, you’ll join the wondrous world of Spellweaver - Words of Power. There you’ll see a Wand and a book full of all kinds of Spells. – insert foto szene oder einzel wand und buch. 
Above both the book and the stand with said wand you’ll find two boards. One will show you the performance of your cast, while the other gives you two play options: Sandbox or Challenge. Both will spawn different kind of enemy types, but only one will give you a time limit and a final score.

{{<section title="Future">}}
Our main goal would be to add more animations and maybe extended game mechanics to have a more immersive game experience. For example, it is ideal to make it a tower defense game or to add different types of enemies and spells. As well as a more detailed analytics board with more statistical values like response time would be cool. In our WER-algorithm we want to add a value that stands for the general understanding of the whole transcribed sentence, that should serve a better valuation basis of each API.
