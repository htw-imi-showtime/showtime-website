{{<section title="Development">}}

## To create a game in virtual reality, we needed some software to develop it and to run it on device

- **Rider,VS Code,VS** these three were our favourite IDE's for C# develepment in Unity
- **Unity** was our main tool to work with the XR components, create the scenes, game objects, and to bring our game more and more to life
- **Oculus** is necessary to set up our VR-Glasses
- **Sidequest** is like a second app store we needed to start the game on device
