At the beginning of the project, there was a brainstorming phase where we as a group wanted to define what kind of use cases would be possible, which one we are going to implement and how we should prioritaze it.
We had different ideas like chat assistent, feature with text to speech but we ended up with choosing 3 use cases: curated shopping list, product comparison and short description. 

The first week was focused on onboarding, reading OpenAI documentation and prompt engineering. We built an Chrome Extension to be able to add features on Idealo website. After we were set up, we started working on our tickets individually, sharing our progress, ideas and getting feedback from our supervisor Jakob during weekly meetings.
