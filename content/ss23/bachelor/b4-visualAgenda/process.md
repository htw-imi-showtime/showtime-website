Our journey began with a crucial kickoff meeting, where we discussed the project's milestones and set the schedules for their completion. During this meeting, the team collaborated to find suitable meeting days and times that would accommodate everyone's busy schedules.
In our subsequent meetings, we focused on comprehensive progress updates. We discussed the tasks we had been diligently working on and candidly addressed any challenges we encountered along the way. These open discussions allowed us to learn from our experiences and adapt our strategies for even better outcomes. As each meeting progressed, we made sure to diligently review and plan for upcoming tasks. 
For our process we had two primary phases: the conception phase and the development phase.

In the early stages, our team focused on brainstorming and sketching out ideas for Visual Agenda. We carefully crafted wireframes that outlined the app's structure and functionality, ensuring a clear and intuitive user experience. Through multiple rounds of feedback and refinement, we went along created a design for our app.

With the blueprint in place, we delved into the development phase. Our skilled team worked on building the frontend, bringing the designs to life with a seamless and engaging interface. Simultaneously, we worked on the backend, ensuring robust functionality and data management.

Throughout the process, we conducted rigorous testing, ensuring the app's reliability and performance under various scenarios.
