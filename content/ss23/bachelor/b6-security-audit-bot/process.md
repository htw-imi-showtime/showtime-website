{{<section title="Organization / Team management">}}

Project management was mainly done via GitLab, with the GitLab server provided by our project supervisors David Koschnick (Product Owner) and Christoph Bork (Stakeholder).
We followed agile methods and focused primarily on scrum-like project management.
However, due to the small size, we made some deviations from a pure scrum approach.

At the beginning of the project we brought together our individual skills and interests and developed a shared vision for the product.
Although no one had experience in the areas we were supported by the expertise of our project mentors.

Initially, collaboration and knowledge sharing took place mainly in our weekly scrum meetings.
Later, we began to record our findings, which helped us better track the concept and product vision.

We used the issue and milestones board for our weekly sprints and used the GitLab wiki feature as our documentation area to share our knowledge.
Although there were challenges we successfully overcame them and evolved as a team.
We adapted our project management to get the most out of our small group and successfully work towards our common goal/vision.

{{<section title="MVP creation">}}

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was developed in parallel with creation of the system flow diagram.
After deciding what was realistically feasible to implement, we constructed the general user flow and arranged each function dependency in the appropriate execution order.
For real-time collaboration, we used the website â€œhttps://www.drawio.com/" and completed the system flow diagram on 30 May.

The MVP consists of the chatbot, login, user context detection, chat persistence, UI hub, port scanner, service scanner, vulnerability scanning, vulnerability assessment and service security advisory.

{{<section title="Project execution">}}

During the project, we followed agile methods and held our weekly sprint meetings every Tuesday.
These meetings served as productive communication and allowed us to keep the team informed about our progress and to discuss any problems with the supervisors.
We also held pair programming sessions on Thursdays to strengthen teamwork and share information.

For comprehensive documentation, milestone monitoring and task management, we used GitLab, which accompanied us throughout the project.

As we continued, we divided the work and tried to work together as efficiently as possible.
We created a diagram of the product to get a clear idea of its structure.
Furthermore, we delved into the basics of how hackers could attack a service connected to the internet to effectively ensure security.
The use of ticket boards and retrospectives allowed us to efficiently solve problems that arose and optimise our workflow.
