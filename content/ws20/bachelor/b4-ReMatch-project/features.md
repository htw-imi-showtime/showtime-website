{{<section title="User roles">}} 
- In our application we have **two roles**: recruiter and job seeker. The recruiter can create job offers and job seekers can fill out their resume.

{{<section title="Simple sign up">}}
- The user **fills out a questionnaire** where they answer questions about the job or employee they are looking for. A job seeker answers questions about their own **skills, expectations and values**. A recruiter fills out their expectations on a job seeker and information about what their company offers.
- Afterwards they can **sign up** with an email address and password.

{{<section title="Job search">}}

{{<section title="Email notification">}}
- A job seeker has the option to **express interest** in a job offer by sending a message to a match. The recruiter will receive an **email notification** with a link to the job seeker's profile. Likewise, recruiters can reach out to candidates they match with.
