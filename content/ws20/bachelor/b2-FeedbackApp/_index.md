{{<section title="Our Mission">}}
**Communication** is key, right? How often have you been in a call where no questions were asked or no suggestions for improvement were made by the participants?

It's already challenging to establish a healthy communicative environment in general and this is an even bigger task to achieve during a global pandemic where many people switched from working in an office to working remotely from home. 

Feedback is an essential part of communication. Both positive and negative feedback can be very helpful and improve more than just internal communication. It can create a culture of continued improvement. This could be done by scheduled one on ones, lengthy monthly meetings that take time **OR** our feedback app: A short questionnaire that can be submitted in a blink of an eye with feedback which can be acted on immediately.
