{{<section title="Feedback">}}
The main purpose of our application is to get **good and constructive feedback** to enhance meetings in an agile work environment.

{{<section title="Fast and easy">}}
To get people to respond on a daily basis this process has to be quick and easy. Therefore we focussed on getting the best possible assessments with only a few clicks.
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Automation">}}
Since our app is connected to the Outlook API, the invitation links for the questionnaires get sent out 5 minutes after the meeting automatically to the meeting attendees. The same goes for the evaluation link which gets sent out 1 day after the meeting.

{{<section title="Evaluation">}}
All replies from the attendees are summarized in an easily understandable table and are presented with pie charts on a separate **evaluation page**.

{{<section title="Privacy">}}
Being able to **respond anonymously** was very important for us. This also gives room for feedback that might have never been given in person.
