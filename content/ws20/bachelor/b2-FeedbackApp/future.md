Meeting owners already get their respective evaluations for hosted meetings. But, wouldn't it be great to see if the received feedback has led to an overall improvment of the meeting quality?
 
We thought of implementing a view for meeting owners, where they can see their meeting performance over time. The idea was to show a graph or a timeline for a week, month or a specified period. This could give an indication if the feedback from all the meeting attendees has bore fruit or if there is still room for improvement. You can say it's feedback about the feedback. Inception anyone?
