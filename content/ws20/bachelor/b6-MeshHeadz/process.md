{{<section title="Design Thinking Process">}}
**Ever since our team started working together, we have been integrating the method of Design Thinking - a non-linear, iterative process - to our project work. We went back and forth through the six stages to continuously improve our product.**

{{<section title="First Steps">}}
With a few ideas in mind we spent time researching to come up with potential technologies that best suit our goal and planned our next steps. 

After we had a general understanding of the needs of our potential users, we **defined the core problems** that we identified up to the point. With this in mind we **collected as many ideas as possible, evaluated them and started prioritizing**.

{{<section title="Improvements">}}
In order to build a user friendly app we performed multiple **usability tests**.
The resulting feedback was then incorporated into the development process to constantly improve our prototypes.

{{<section title="Meet And Discuss">}}
Tasks were collected on an **issue board** on the version control platform **Gitlab**. This way it was always possible to see which tasks were already in progress and which were still on the agenda.

In the weekly meetings with our supervisors, we presented our achievements and discussed issues that required clarification.
