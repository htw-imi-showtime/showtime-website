{{<section title="Unity & Oculus VR">}}

The Project was presented as an Oculus Quest VR Game in Unity from the very beginning - and we were quite happy with these tools. 
While some of us already had some experience in Unity, we still took our time to get to know the engine properly. 
Oculus offers an [Integration Package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) for Unity, which helped us to get started with VR development. While the Oculus Quest is not the most powerful VR headset,
there were many instances in which we were glad to be working with standalone glasses that did not need to be plugged into a PC. 
However, as of recently, Oculus VR can only be used with a Facebook account, which was unfortunate because we had to share our credit card information to get a developer account,
and we partly had to share accounts, since some credit cards were not accepted.
We also ran into compatibility problems with Oculus support on MacOs, which slowed down development and testing.
Nonetheless, the overall work with the Oculus Quest was a positive experience.

{{<section title="GitHub">}}
Many of us had little to no experience with Git at the beginning of this project.
Luckily those with more experience were able to help and recommended useful tools to learn Git.
We also decided on a Git workflow at the beginning of our development and documented it in our repository to avoid at least some merge conflicts and risk losing our work.
We used GitHub over any other tool since we wanted to share our code publicly. Sadly this is no longer possible as we are using some paid assets in our game.
We made a lot of use of the review functionality in GitHub, because we had decided to do code reviews on all of our pull requests.

{{<section title="Maya & Blender">}}
For some of our needs, we couldn't find any free or affordable assets that would suit our needs perfectly.
This is why, some of us dug out their past knowledge of Maya from the attic, and used it to model some small 3D objects for our game, such as the “Drawing-Symbols”, in Maya and later on in Blender too.

{{<section title="Project Management">}}
Our main communication tool was Discord, where we had multiple text and voice channels to share resources, discuss tasks and hold team meetings.
To organize our tasks we worked with Trello where we had one board with multiple lists – one for each step of the development. 
Each task was assigned to at least one team member and we added labels to mark the importance and urgency of a task. 
If there ever was the need to write something down, such as our game concepts, the game story, and meeting protocols, we used Google Docs for it. 
This way multiple team members could work together at the same time.
