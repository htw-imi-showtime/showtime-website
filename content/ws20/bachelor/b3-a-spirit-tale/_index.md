In our game, the Player starts in an apartment, with their eyes on the main menu (TV). 
Before them, on a table, lies the tutorial, which they can read if there is the need to. 
Using their controllers and a pointer, they can interact with the TV screen, where they can select one out of three game levels. 
Once they select a level, they get teleported into a black and white version of said level, where they have to fight against different kinds of enemies,
either by hitting the targets upon their bodies, retracing symbols with a pointer or by copying their poses - all while dodging their attacks.
With each defeated enemy, the map slowly gains back its original color and the player learns about the history of their environment. 
Once the map regains its previous radiance, the player then gets the option of continuing on in the same world, to increase his highscore, or to move on to a new and exciting world.
