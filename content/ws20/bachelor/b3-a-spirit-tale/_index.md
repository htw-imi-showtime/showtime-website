In our game, the player starts in an apartment, with their eyes on the main menu (TV). 
Before them, on a table, lies the tutorial, which they can read if there is the need to. 
Using their controllers and a pointer, they can interact with the TV screen, where they can select one out of **three game levels**. 
Once they select a level, they get teleported into a black and white version of said level, where they have to fight against different kinds of enemies,
either by **hitting the targets** upon their bodies, **retracing symbols** with a pointer or by **copying their poses** - all while **dodging their attacks**.
With each defeated enemy, the map slowly gains back its original color and the player learns about the history of their environment. 
Once the map regains its previous radiance, the player then gets the option of continuing on in the same world, to increase their highscore, or to move on to a new and exciting world.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The **A Spirit Tale** team benefits from a wide diversity across categories, such as semester, age and culture. For this project,
we all came together and poured our passion for games and VR into it.

At the very beginning each of us stated what kind of tasks they were interested in working on, which we then used as a guideline,
while distributing our tasks. Bartholomäus, Marie and Pauline mainly worked on **game programming**, while Juri, Nima and Nuri focused on **game design/art**.
And finally we are all very thankful to our supervisor Prof. Strippgen for his support, fresh ideas and regular feedback.
