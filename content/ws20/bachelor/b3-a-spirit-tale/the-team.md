{{<section title="The Team">}}
The “A Spirit Tale” team benefits from a wide diversity across categories, such as semester, age and culture. For this project, 
we all came together and poured our passion for games and VR into it.

At the very beginning each of us stated what kind of tasks they were interested in working on, which we then used as a guideline, 
while distributing our tasks. Bartholomäus, Marie and Pauline mainly worked on game programming, while Juri, Nima and Nuri focused on game design/art.
