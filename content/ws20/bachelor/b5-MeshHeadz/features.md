**Our MeshHeadz application has, as already indicated, a broad spectrum of features but is nevertheless designed to be simple and clear.**  


{{<section title="Create Your Own Projects">}} 
After first opening the app, users are able to create as many individual projects as they please, to save their photographs and 3D-models in an organized way. 
{{</section>}}


{{<section title="Take Photos With The Built In Camera">}} 
In order to create a 3D-model of their head, users must be able to include photos they have taken in their projects. 

Within each project there is a **project gallery** where users either can take photos with the help of the **built in camera** or **import them from their phone gallery**. These photos are then **stored in a project folder on the phone**, especially created for each project. 

Since not everything always goes the way it should, users are also able to **delete created projects as well as taken or imported photos**.

{{<section title="Generate A 3D-Model With Only One Button Tap">}} 

After the users took or imported as many photos as they want, they are only one button tap and a short waiting period away from their own individual 3D-model of their head. 

With the tap on the **SEND TO SERVER** button in our app, many backend processes are triggered. 
The project folder, that includes all the photos, is automatically zipped, sent via our Web Server to another server and that is where the **photogrammetry software Meshroom creates a 3D-model and sends the result back** the way it came.

{{<section title="Spin Your 3D-Head Right Round, Right Round">}} 

When everything went well and the processing is done an **object file is sent back to our app**, which means that the users are now able to open the built in **3D-model-viewer**. There they can look at their created _MeshHead_, spin it around and adjust display options, like changing the background or the texture, as they prefer it.

{{<section title="Since Some May Wonderâ€¦What About The Duck?">}} 
One fine day during a lecture, _"Eberhard der Erpel"_ waddled onto our screens and has since become part of the team. Through his sheer presence, he only brought joy to our group during the semester. That is why we decided to use him as a mascot and as an app logo.
