#### Flutter/Dart
We didn't know instantly what kind of frameweork and programming language we should choose.
Neither of us had any real experiences with app developing until the full end. So anything was
possible. After a while of self research we had two candidates React Native and Flutter
and we decided for the latter. As we went through the reviews of active
developers we got the following recommendation: As students we should try learn Flutter/Dart,
we have still time to learn new stuff and should take the opportunity. Flutter gains quickly popularity.
It may seem difficult from the first sight - Dart was a new language to us - but it's object-oriented and
synthactically almost similar to Java and Javascript. Cross-platform app developement is also
provided. So we thought, why not, let's do it!


#### Firebase ML Kit
We're using a Flutter plugin which provides all machine learning methods like face detection,
barcode detecting and in our case text recognition.

#### Android Studio and Intelli J
Unfortunately after installing FLutter with Android Studio some of us missed the full
repertoire of mobile app programming. Neither the emulator was working nor the access to
the device file explorer. As a consequence half of the group had to go for Intelli J.
The whole installation process needed much more time as we expected.

#### GitHub/git
We decided for Github as our hosting plattform and we worked with git commands.

#### Miro
Miro board was a good plattform for visualizing our ideas, suggestions and useful links.
To have an overview of who is currently working on what, we kept using Miro board and
visualized it with pin's.

#### Discord/Zoom
Discord was mainly our communication plattform through the whole project semester. Zoom was
used for meetings with our supervisor.
