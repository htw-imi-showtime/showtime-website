While things like improving the text recognition or speeding up the scanning are ongoing processes, we still have some ideas for new features that will improve the app.
One thing that is on our bucket list, is to contact the European Commission because they have shown interest in projects that use their data. 
The European Commission has other datasets that are related to the CosIng dataset that we use, so we want to expand our dataset and implement relations between these datasets.

{{<section title="Profiles">}}
We want to personalise our app. The idea is to have profiles for the users and providing features like marking substances that the user has had bad experiences with.
It also allows us to save the data in the cloud.

#### Groups for common allergies
There are a couple of common allergies like peanuts and shellfish out there. Our idea is to have groups for these allergies. Once a user selects one of the products, we mark all the related allergies to that product. It should make the initial setup of our app a little easier.

#### Advanced camera
While our camera does what it is supposed to do, it is still pretty bare bones. Post-processing for the pictures is the keyword here. Little things like adjusting the brightness so the text recognition has an easier time recognizing the text. We also want to give the user options like turning on the flash lights etc.
