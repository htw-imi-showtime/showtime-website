 I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity
 has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
 which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence
 in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy,
 my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
 that I neglect my talents.
