While things like improving the text recognition or speeding up the scanning are ongoing processes, we still have some ideas for new features that will improve the app.
One thing that is on our bucket list, is to contact the **European Commission** because they have **shown interest** in projects that use their data. 
The European Commission has other datasets that are related to the CosIng dataset that we use, so we want to **expand our dataset** and implement relations between these datasets.

#### Groups for common allergies
There are a couple of common allergies like peanuts and shellfish out there. Our idea is to have **groups** for these allergies. Once a user selects one of the products, we **mark all the related allergies** to that product. It should make the **initial setup** of our app a little **easier**.

#### Advanced camera
While our camera does what it is supposed to do, it is still pretty bare bones. **Post-processing for our images** is the keyword here. Little things like **adjusting the brightness** so the text recognition has an easier time recognising the text. We also want to give the user options like **turning on the flashlight** etc.

#### Barcode scanning
There are a couple of apps out there that can scan the barcode of cosmetic products. While scanning the text is generally a better idea because not all products have barcodes on them, scanning the barcode still has a **couple of perks**, so **providing both options** is something we will look into as an upcoming feature.

#### Expandable database by users
One of our ideas would be to **give the users the chance** to **improve our app** by adding useful information to the substances itself. They could either **add additional information** to the content that is already there or just have some **notes** to the substances, like their **prior experiences**, connections to other substances, etc.
