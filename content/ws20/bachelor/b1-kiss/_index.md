Kiss is intended for people who want to be more **concious** about their cosmetic products. Kiss keeps track of your allergies and **warns** you whenever you scan a product with an allergic ingredient in it. Kiss runs on both **IOS** and **Android** and **doens't require an internet connection** after the initial download.


{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
For most people, the chemical ingredients on the back of cosmetic products are meaningless.
Very few people understand what a "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil" is. This is where our app comes into place. We wanted to **help people understand** what it **means** and what it **does**. The **work** that the user has to put in to get the information needed, should be **as little as possible**. It also **shouldn't be dependant** on factors like a **good internet connection** or a **barcode**.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
Jonathan, Henry and Anton were initially responsible for the backend.
Kenneth was responsible for the basic structure of our app and the UI.
Kieu and Niklas had the task of implementing the text recognition plugin.
After having our **prototype**, we found ourselves together in one big group again and from that point on were developing either alone or in smaller groups while **keeping in touch** with the other group members.
We had **at least two meetings** every week and got along very well.
