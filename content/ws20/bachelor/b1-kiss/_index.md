KISS is intended for people who want to be more **concious** about their cosmetic products. KISS keeps track of your allergies and **warns** you whenever you scan a product with an allergic ingredient in it. KISS runs on both **IOS** and **Android** and **doens't require an internet connection** after the initial download.

{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
For most people, the chemical ingredients on the back of cosmetic products are meaningless.
Very few people understand what a "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil" is. This is where our app comes into place. We wanted to **help people understand** what it **means** and what it **does**. The **work** that the user has to put in to get the information needed, should be **as little as possible**. It also **shouldn't be dependant** on factors like a **good internet connection** or products with **barcodes**.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
- **Communication is key.** Everyone was working towards the same goal and we all agreed on the importance of communication in that process.
- Everyone of us found something that they were passionate about, which made our development process both **fun and motivating.**
- Henry, Jonathan and Anton were at first responsible for the backend while Kieu, Kenneth and Niklas were implementing the text recognition and UI but we switched around later on.
