{{<section title="Development">}}
Our prototype was developed in Unity version **2019.4.12f1** and the **VRTK version 3**.
We chose these core tools as the group members already had experience developing with them and could apply past knowledge while eliminating learning time.
Furthermore, one group member had previously developed scripts for procedural mesh splitting, which became one of the core functions in our program.

{{<section title="Modeling">}}
Various programs were used for modeling but **Blender version 2.91** took the main stage.
Along with the core features, some free plugins were used, especially for model texturing.
We chose this software as it is completely free, offers all the features we needed and there are vast resources for learners available. 
For the modeling of the hands **ZBrush** and **GIMP** were used.

{{<section title="VR Kit">}}
We used the HTC Vive for testing and development, and both the Vive controllers and Valve Index controllers for user control.

For audio editing Audacity was our tool of choice. Later in the process Adobe Illustrator and Premiere Pro were also used.
