{{<section title="Training-related task">}}
To provide an ingame objective which represents an everyday work task to the trainees, their instructors were included in the developing process.

When entering the virtual workshop the players receive the task to craft a dice. This requires interaction with cutting machines like the hand lever or the guillotine shears as well as the bench drill to perforate the metal workpieces. To set the final product together, a glue gun needs to be used.

{{<section title="Interactable realistic machines">}}
In order to allow the trainees to transfer their prior learning experiences to the virtual world and vice versa, the machines were modeled after their real life counterparts.
One of the biggest challenges hereby was the adaption of the handling to the VR medium.

{{<section title="Bench Drill">}}
The bench drill is the most complex of all the modeled machines.
Users must follow the correct sequence of operational steps to stay safe or risk serious injury.
Interactions include adjustment of drill bits, the fastening of a workpiece in the operational vice, toggling a light and turning the machine on and off.

{{<section title="Hand lever shear">}}
The hand lever shear is used to cut smaller pieces and strips of metal.
This tool provides a higher level of accuracy and a more convenient operation than the guillotine shear.
To operate it, users must unhinge the safety hook and pull the lever down, thereby executing the cutting movement of the blade. Not only can they slice their fingers off but also knock themselves out when hit by the unsecured lever.

{{<section title="Guillotine shear">}}
The guillotine shear is used to cut larger sheets of metal down to size. To do so, a sheet is layed on the operating surface and positioned under the blade.
The shear needs to be turned on via a switch on the left side. On button press, the blade is pushed down onto the workpiece, separating excess material.

{{<section title="Glue Gun">}}
To set up the previously crafted pieces, the glue gun can be used to permanently attach objects. 
Therefore the glue guns trigger has to be pressed while shoving it above the preferred object, which then can be sticked onto another piece.

{{<section title="Injury simulation">}}
One of the core concepts of our project is to give an impression of how badly one can hurt themselves as a consequence of improper machine operation.
At the same time we do not want to scare the trainees away from using the machines they need for their work.
During user testing we received mixed opinions on the graphic detail shown - some thought they could be more detailed (gory), while others thought it might be overwhelming for sensitive users.
The head teacher of the metal workshop stressed that showing what is real is important - trainees should be aware of the severity of possible injuries.

**Clipboard Feedback** - In case you used one of the machines the wrong way, the screen will fade out until it becomes black. 
Afterwards you will see a clipboard which tells you exactly what you did wrong and how you can do it right the next time using this machine.
