{{<section title="Abstract">}}
**Can you complete the work assignment while keeping all your fingers?**

‘Gefahr erkannt, Gefahr gebannt’ is a VR learning application for teaching occupational safety measures, which targets trainees in metal workshops.
In our simulation users can process basic materials with various tools modeled after real life examples and must be careful not to hurt themselves.
In order to avoid serious injuries, they must choose the required safety equipment as well as operate the machines properly.

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
With our application we want to offer trainees in metal workshops an additional and engaging safety training in virtual reality.
This training illustrates dangerous situations by showing injuries that can occur when working with the machines as realistically as possible.

Achieving our goal means making our users more perceptive towards hazard cues and possible risks while practicing their crafts(wo)manship.
