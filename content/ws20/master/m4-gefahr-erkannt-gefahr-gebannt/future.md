{{<section title="Our Future Plans">}}
Our team is very focused to keep working on our project in this coming semester. 

As far as we have come now it gives us a very good foundation to come forward with our work in our VR application. 
We hope we can make it even better for users and maybe even provide it for other work fields. One field, which was especially asked for, would e.g. be wood work. 
Furthermore we would like to stay in touch with the people from the [AVT](https://www.avt-bildung.de/) and the [bfw](https://www.bfw.de/berlin/das-bfw-in-berlin-technische-berufe/),
so that they are able to use this application to train their safety measures as to learn the real consequences.
