{{<section title="The development process">}}
Throughout the duration of the project, we worked in a 'Scrum-ban' mode. While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a 'what-is-needed' basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn't have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.

In order to work on a ticket, the person who wanted to work on it claimed it, created a branch off of develop based on our naming conventions and, whenever they thought it was done, created a merge request.

All new code had to be reviewed before being merged into the develop branch. We never merged our code before a given merge request was approved by a a person who had not developed the feature. When merge requests became too large, the person who implemented it would sit down with a reviewer and walk them through it, adapting the code where it was needed.
