{{<section title="The development process">}}
Throughout the duration of the project, we worked in a 'Scrum-ban' mode. While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a 'what-is-needed' basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn't have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.

In order to work on a ticket, the person who wanted to work on it claimed it, created a branch off of develop based on our naming conventions and, whenever they thought it was done, created a merge request.
In the beginning of our development, we often ran into problems with actually getting the merge requests reviewed and approved. To counteract that, we agreed upon a process, where we'd notify the rest of the team in our chat, as emails sent by Gitlab were often ignored.

{{<section title="Code-review is important!">}}
All new code had to be reviewed before being merged into the develop branch. We never merged our code before a given merge request was approved by a a person who had not developed the feature. When merge requests became too large, the person who implemented it would sit down with a reviewer and walk them through it, adapting the code where it was needed.

{{<section title="Corona and Remote Work">}}
Due to Corona, our semester and team work were also conducted fully remotely. We had weekly team meetings and often substituted those by having multiple calls during the week /  Sprint. While some of the decisions might have been taken more quickly in an onsite setting, we found that pair-programming remotely worked well with the tool we had chosen.
