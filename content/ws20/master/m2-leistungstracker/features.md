Athletimize facilitates training planning and management by including holistic data. It provides the following features to athletic teams and organizations:

{{<section title="Assessments">}}
We have two types of assessments:
* Daily assessments are answered everyday in the morning. The questions range from the athlete's state of mind to their body condition
* Session assessments are answered right after a training or match has taken place.
The athletes give their personal view about the intensity of the session and provide the time that they were involved.

The assessments are typically answered on the phone, so we focused on making these very easy to use.
We also played around with modern Web API features like the Bluetooth API.
This allowed us to capture the heartbeat from a coupled device (we tested with a MI Band 2) right inside the browser.

{{<section title="Reports">}}

The reports area is built for the coach. It provides a quick overview of the status of the players with the overall score of the team at a selected date.
The score and all other metrics were developed by the University of Bern.
The coach can also dive in to see more detailed statistics by selecting a specific metric or explore the detailed status of a specific athlete.

{{<section title="Session Planning">}}
A central task in team sports lies in planning the training sessions.
In our current version, we have added very basic support to keep track of these sessions so they can be coupled with the assessment responses and performance data that we tracked.
We are planning to take this to the next level by adding a fancy planning tool for individual sessions in the future.

{{<section title="Team Management">}}
Club staff have their own area where they can manage the team.
Athletimize supports multiple teams per instance where each team has different members with different roles.
