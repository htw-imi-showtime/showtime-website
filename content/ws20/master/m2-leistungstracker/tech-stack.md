{{<section title="React & Typescript">}}
For our Frontend we decided to use ReactJs with Typescript. This gave us the advantage of having a well-documented library with a plethora of available resources. React is relatively easy to learn and it allowed us to have a modular structure where we could build various reusable components. To improve and ensure code-quality, we set up very strict linting and formatting rules.

{{<section title="NestJs & Typescript">}}
We used NestJS, a TypeScript framework for Node.js backend apps. This gave us a good modular structure and resulted in a clean architecture with a good testing setup.
The Postgres database is accessed via TypeORM.
