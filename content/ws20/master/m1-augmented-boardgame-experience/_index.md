{{<section title="Our Considerations">}}
In our project we investigated the possibility of improving a traditional board game with modern technology. Due to the lockdowns during the corona situation, we developed a particular interest in the idea of a **digital board game**. It offers the possibility to have **common game nights** with friends **despite social distancing**. The board game can be shared via a desktop screen for all players to see. And players can join the game using their smartphones. The advantage of this variant is that, for example, it is easier to **conduct secret agreements or information** during the game using the smartphone. This guarantees that no unauthorized person will find out about it. Furthermore, less physical material is needed and it is very easy to switch between languages. Moreover the integration of a **"smart" opponent** is possible with the help of a digital board game. In addition, the atmosphere of the game can be supported with **suitable music**. Since most game lovers enjoy the luck required when **rolling the dice**, we wanted to preserve this aspect. Above all, it was important to us not to leave out the **social aspect** of a game night, despite the use of a smartphone. That's why we placed a lot of emphasis on ensuring that **communication** remains important in our game concept.

{{<section title="The Game Description">}}
In the game "The Mole" players take on the role of **Scotland Yard detectives**. Sherlock Holmes asks them to help him solve a **mysterious murder case**. While the players search for evidence to **find the murderer**, they are in the greatest **danger**, because the murderer is now targeting them. The goal of the game is to arrive at Scotland Yard before the murderer catches up with them. Also, you must find at least four solid pieces of evidence by then to finally arrest the murderer. The players can't win without colluding with each other, but beware! **Among them is a mole, a traitor who is in cahoots with the murderer.**

{{<section title="The Team">}}
Our team consists of seven people. The concept of the game idea was worked out and defined in the team. After the concept was set, Kevin, Lena and Shari created the design of the game in a prototype. Furthermore, the team split up: Chris, Keoma, Kevin and Lena took care of the frontend, i.e. the development of the board view and the player view. Bruno, Johannes and Shari took care of the backend, i.e. setting up the server, the database and implementing the game logic.
