{{<section title="Architecture">}}
The following graphic describes the software architecture of the game "The Mole".
 
There are two basic elements in the architecture, a backend server and a frontend server. Both our servers are deployed on the cloud application platform **Heroku**. Furthermore all instances communicate using **SocketIO**. SocketIO is a library for real-time web applications that enables bidirectional real-time communication between web clients and servers. 
 
In the backend we used Python as a programming language with the **Django** web framework. Our data is stored in the object-relational database system **PostgreSQL**. This is supported by Django as well as by Heroku. 
 
In the frontend we used **Vue.js**, a JavaScript frontend framework for declarative rendering and component composition. Furthermore we extended Vue.js with **NuxtJS**, a JavaScript frontend framework with functionalities like routing, state management, universal rendering and more. To quickly build responsive designs, we used the CSS-Framework **Tailwind**.

Clients can open the game as a **progressive web app**. This means that the game is available as a responsive website, but can additionally be used like an app. When the player connects to the frontend they basically create their own client. That helps us with communication.
