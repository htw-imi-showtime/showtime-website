{{<teaser category="about showtime" title="Projects over Distance">}}

This term is the second term already that all projects and our Showtime are held in
a distance format - sad, but also an opportunity to explore the projects
from afar! Just dip in for one or two project presentations, visit the projects
in their virtual booths or watch the presentation videos,
websites, and demos when it fits you best!

{{<teaser category="projects" title="One Term Ten Projects">}}
Bachelor students do one, Master students two practical projects during their studies. This term, we
are happy to present six projects in the Bachelor's and four Projects in the Master's programme.

{{<teaser category="schedule" title="Almost as in real life">}}
We try to mimick our "real" showtime as closely as possible - there will be short project presentations in the morning, and
a project fair with virtual booths and plenty of opportunities to explore the projects in the afternoon.
