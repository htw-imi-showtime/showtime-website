{{<teaser category="about showtime" title="Projects over Distance">}}

This Term is already the second term all projects and our showtime are held in
a distance format - sad, but also an opportunity to explore the projects
from afar! Just dip in for one or two project presentations, visit the projects
in their virtual booths or watch the presentation videos,
websites and demos at your chosen time.

We try to mimick our "real" showtime as close as possible - there will be short project presentations in the morning, and
virtual booths in the afternoon.
