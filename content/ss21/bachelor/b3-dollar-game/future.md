{{<section title="So, what's next?">}}
We still have many plans! Our game currently allows the player to start with any level and any difficulty he likes. We want to encourage a total play through and will implement **_unlockable levels_** in the future. Who knows, maybe you’ll be able to unlock some **_easter eggs_** too?

Additionally, we are already able to reset singular levels, but what if you want to show it to a friend? As you don’t want to show him a half played game, a **_reset function_** for the whole game process is on our to-do list for the future.

- **More Levels**

Three difficulties aren’t enough for us. We want to create **_more complicated_** levels that challenge you more than ever. But if you are not ready for the hardcore mode yet, we will make *more easy, normal and hard levels* additionally to the old ones.

- **More Fun**

We as the developers only have one perspective on the game. Players are encouraged to give us their **_feedback_**. Because only the players truly know what is fun and not, what features they want or what has to get improved.

- **More Compatibility with smartphones**

In order to further our accesibility we will implement smarthone support for all systems.
