- The high score system remembers the player's best solution for each individual level. A step counter follows the player through his round and keeps track of their number of moves. The less moves the better. And in case of a misclick, the return button helps to save the players score.

{{<section title="Assets and Animation" >}}

- Self made and self animated, our assets give the game its flair. With our pixelated style and beautiful art, the game starts to shine: 14 different islands, 8 connecting rocks and multiple background drawings were created by our artists. And with a few lines of code, the animation brings the game to its lively state. Not only is our main menu equipped with an animated background, our islands and connections are too! With a simple click of the mouse, you see the islands that share their values wiggle in the sky.
