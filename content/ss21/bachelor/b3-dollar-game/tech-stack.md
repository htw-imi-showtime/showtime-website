{{<section title="Phaser 3 & JavaScript">}}

Early on we knew we needed a framework. With **JavaScript** as a familiar language to most, we decided to aim our search and found **Phaser**, an open source **HTML5** game framework. None of us knew this framework, but we were able to learn as we went. For some time we were not sure if the need for the framework was there, but in the long run it certainly was a good decision to stick with it.

{{<section title="Node.js & Express.js">}}

Node Package Manager helped us to implement external packages ( e.g. **Phaser**) to our project. We also used **Express.js** for creating a simple server for our **Node.js** application, which we needed in order to deploy our application to **Heroku**.

{{<section title="Heroku">}}

We chose **Heroku** to deploy and manage our application, because it is offering developers a simple and elegant path to getting their apps to the market. **Heroku** is very flexible, easy to use and most importanlty it gives a scalable platform to deploy products over the cloud without taking care of infrastructure.

{{<section title="Webpack">}}

**Webpack** is a tool that lets developers to compile **JavaScript** modules. Given a large number of files and assets, it generates a single file(bundle) that run the application.

- **GitHub/git**

####

**GitHub** was an already well known platform for all of us, since it was put close to our hearts in our earlier studies. As we needed a code sharing and version controlling system, we chose it without second thought. In our processes, new features were added in new branches, reviewed by at least another member of the group and merged to the master. This way the whole group was in control of the latest functioning version of the game.

- **Miro**

In our Project Management classes we used **Miro Board** for exercises, homeworks and information.

- **Confluence and Jira**

For further organisation in our SCRUM workflow, **Jira** was a welcome software. With its Roadmap, Backlog and Board functions, the planning of our project was rather simple. **Confluence** was a great addition to this planning process, since it gave opportunity for shared documents, files and general note keeping.

- **Discord/Zoom**

Since meetups in person were still out of question due to Covid-19, we were in need of communication platforms. **Zoom** was already prepared by our supervisor and was used for meetings with Professor Dr. Jung as well as our project management supervisor, Mrs. Metzner. For our personal group meetings as well as all other communications, we preferred **Discord** as a familiar platform and main communication device between most students of the HTW. Multiple voice and text channels gave opportunity to organise topics and save important decisions.
