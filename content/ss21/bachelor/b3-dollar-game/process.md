{{<section title="Research">}}
Many questions were thrown into the pot upon our first meeting as a group. Since our game is based on graph theory, we needed to decide how we want to design it, what its general goals are and what programming languages and frameworks we want to use. Research and Brainstorming was the order of the day. We dedicated our first weeks fully on the first, but very important decisions. After many discussions we found conclusions to our issues: we decided to use Phaser as a framework, JavaScript as our programming language, make a game with flying islands as our general idea and started to follow the SCRUM workflow.

{{<section title="SCRUM">}}
SCRUM is a framework for agile development. It aims for faster project development with lower risks by creating interim goals in so-called “sprints”, that envelop a short period of time, like a week. After each sprint, coworkers present and summarise the finished work in a sprint review.
In cooperation with our supervisors, we were able to integrate SCRUM into our workflow, which highly improved our proficiency, work ethic and motivation.

{{<section title="Prototyping">}}
In our first sprints, we created a first prototype. A main menu, level menu and first level was made. It was a basis for our continued sprints and work, to add further features, improve existing necessities and pep up the assets and design.

The continuing weeks we concentrated on many topics, from design to programming to idea collections for future features.
Remarkable are the music features, improved game mechanics and many added functions like repeat buttons, step back and the general menu, that all have been programmed in JavaScript and Phaser. Additionally to the program itself, game analysis and levels had to be made, for the content of the game. We often split the team in multiple groups every week to have an agile workflow in all categories of the game.

{{<section title="Designing">}}
For the design process, we needed to decide what type of assets and style we wanted to use. We searched for inspiration and quickly created multiple sketches of first ideas. After those initial steps, we decided on the pixel art style, since it's a common indie game aesthetic that we as gamers appreciate. With that it went onto the actual drawing process, where many of us learned new skills.
The logo was the last to be made, since we wanted a clear idea of our game, before creating such an important branding. Out of 16 options, we chose the simple text on islands, since it emphasises the general theme of our game.

The last weeks were filled with bug fixing, level designing and implementation of design elements and animations. The finishing touches were added, while some members of the group started working on the video and website that you are visiting right now.
