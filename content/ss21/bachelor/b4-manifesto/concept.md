The Marc Sinan Company shared the main idea with us: how the inner room of a church should be turned into an interactive area where one has to work together with the others; the event should act as a memorial to the victims of the National Socialist Underground murders.

The concept is the project foundation and was developed in **collaboration and coordination with the Marc Sinan Company**. An important point here was dividing the whole act into substeps to define the possible states of it. The starting point of the interaction is the whole floor area with a smaller area within it acting as the playground.

We developed multiple concepts, discussed and modified them to reach the final idea:

- Unterteilt wird in 4 verschiedene Grundphasen.
- There are at least 2 areas that are part of the interaction.
  **(1) Interaction area (2) Target area**.
- At least one person is needed for the interaction.

  - A circle was selected as the form of the target area.
  - A circle is an appropriate shape for the concept of the event. It **symbolizes togetherness and peace**.
  - Metaphorically, it is assigned the protective function.

  - The final concept includes two circles on each side that can be placed on the area using the User Interface in the Manifesto-Core frontend app.
  - Due to the current situation with the pandemic, multiple circles is a more appropriate solution.
