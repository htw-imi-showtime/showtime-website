#### GitHub/git
We decided to use GitHub as our hosting platform for version control. Every task was completed in separate **feature branches** and we supported each other with reviews of our **pull requests** using this tool.

#### React & HTML/CSS/JS
We used these tools for the opportunity to learn more about one of the leading development tools in the development field as well as to be able to produce a stable product in the minimal time we had left.

#### Material-UI
Material-UI was our decision to add amazingly designed elements to the App with ease and speed.

#### MongoDB
#### nodeJS
