And, as I lie **close to the earth**, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz
of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of
the insects and flies, then I feel **the presence of the Universe**, which formed us in its own image,
and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an
**eternity of bliss;** and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth
seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power.

Have a look at **this list:**
* You get a list item
* And you get a list item
* And you as well
* And you get a list item
* EvErYbOdY gEtS a LiSt ItEm!!!

 I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity
 has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
 which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence
 in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy,
 my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
 that I neglect my talents.
