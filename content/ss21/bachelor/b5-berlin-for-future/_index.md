{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
We at BFF would like to encourage students and young people like us to pay more attention to how their lives affect the climate situation in the world. We want to give them the opportunity to find out more about the situation, introduce advice and information to decrease their own carbon footprint and give them the tools to participate in the Berlin climate change fighting scene.

{{<section title="Our Mission">}}
We set out to create two separate concenpts to support our goals in two different ways. 
After weeks of research, meetings and focus groups we have narrowed our goals to two main fields: **provide information** and **connect**

{{<section title="The Team">}}
What is most important to know about our team is that we are **passionate** about our project goals.

We are an international group of people who came together in the shared motivation to exchange ideas, create fun things using the tools we've learned thus far at uni and most importanly, try to **leave a mark in the climate change fight**.
