#### Miro
We used our Miro board primarily for **planning** our weekly meetings ahead of time and as sort of a blank space for **brainstorming** and working on our **project management** assignments. The wide variety of tools and plugins was of great benefit to us.

#### Trello
Trello was used to keep track of our **Backlog** and document the **progression** of all our tasks. The **kanban style layout** and handy functions like requirements and deadlines made it the perfect choice for the job.

#### Discord
During our time developing Strollr, Discord was the **main hub** for all our conversations, quick questions, short meetups as well as a medium for **exchanging** pictures and **sharing** links or useful **information**.

#### Flutter™️
During the early planning stages, we decided that our application should be able to run on both Android and iOS. As a result of that, we narrowed down our framework options to **React Native** and **Flutter**. 
Having **little to no experience with app development** at that time and relying mainly on our own research and experiences from previous IMI projects, we decided that **Flutter** should be the framework of our choice.
Flutter is provided by Google and based on Dart, a programming language similar to JavaScript. Its biggest advantage is the ability to deploy projects on both **Android and iOS** with **very little adjustments**. Additionally, it is **well documented** and beginner-friendly.

#### Android Studio, IntelliJ or Visual Code?
Instead of specifying one, we used a **variety** of different **IDEs**, all of them offering integration for the Flutter SDK. This way, everyone could choose according to their own preferences and feel comfortable while coding, which was important to us.

#### Google Maps API
For the **tracking capabilities** of our App, we are using the **Google Maps API** for Flutter. It is provided via the **Google Cloud Services** and free to use within a certain request limit. But for our use case, that was **plenty enough**!

#### GitHub
The **version control** system of our choice is **Git** with **GitHub** as the hosting platform. Easy to use, hard to master, but definitely a 
**good training exercise** for later jobs. We struggled with occasional **merge errors** and some other **branching issues**, but managed to overcome them by means of research and team spirit.
