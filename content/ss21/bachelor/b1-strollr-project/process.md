{{<section title="Idea">}}
The **idea** for our app **originated** out of a **conversation** with a **local gardening project**. It is an approach to a rather recent question: _How do you make spending time in nature more appealing to children and adolescents who grew up on smartphones and other mobile devices?_ \
Our supervisor, **Prof. Dr. Lenz** approached us with his initial idea for a **mobile application** which already laid out most of the **core features** that the final version of Strollr incorporates, like the ability to take photos and **visualize walks** with a map. 
During a brainstorm session, we collected our own input and came up with a **design concept**. \
With that in mind, our first **mockups** were created.

After agreeing on **Flutter** as our **development framework**, we briefly **familiarized ourselves** with it, while **researching plugins** and **APIs** that would be helpful in implementing the planned features. \
Going into the development period, we separated the group into **three teams**, concerned with the general **UI**, **map visualization** and **database design**. 
This way, we could focus on different tasks while maintaining communication within the group and making use of agile techniques like **pair programming** and **code review**. 
Maintaining our source code with Git allowed us to simultaneously implement different features on their respective branches and avoid conflicts when integrating them. \
We manifested a **biweekly rhythm for the big team meetings** with our supervisor in which we reviewed our recent progress, **collected feedback** and **set goals** for the **following two-week period**. 
Additional weekly calls with the core team helped us to stay current on each other's progress and resolve potential issues.\
Throughout the development phase, we **continuously updated our Backlog** of ideas, **collectively taking** on the **role** of a **product owner**. Making use of project management tools, we constructed user stories and arranged them in a Story Map, 
thereby identifying and refining **the most important features**.

{{<section title="Reflection">}}
We look back on a project that for many of us posed the **first opportunity** to **experience the development** of a **software product** from start to finish. 
Besides our advancement in **cross-platform application** **development**, creating Strollr taught us a great deal about **planning and managing** larger software projects. \
While communication can be a bit challenging in a team of 8, we never experienced any major misconceptions or disagreements. Naturally, we faced a **few technical** **hurdles** when writing our code, such as **conflicting Flutter plugins** 
or problems with the **cross-platform compatibility** of certain features. However, **determination** and **mutual help** within the team **resolved all the issues** at hand.
