{{<section title="The Team">}}
The team was made up of five people with diverse development backgrounds. Before the start of the project, only two of the five had actively worked on an Android App and Bluetooth development. To improve efficiency and speed, we split into two main focal points: One was setting up and ensuring a stable Bluetooth connection whereas the other dealt more heavily with the Mathematical aspects of the project.
