The cutting edge we have been working on emcompases a number of exciting areas that offer room for expansion. 

Our product (in its current form) makes use of gamification, which remains a debated topic. 
Considering how young our user base is, there is untapped potential, both for the single-user experience as well as an integration in the social setting that an apprenticeship is. 
As with all serious games, the selection and implementation of gamification elements must be carefully made and tested. Gamification, if done wrongly, can be demotivating and,
in our case, even harmful, if too much focus is shifted from the actual lessons of workshop safety to the completion of game goals.

Our product is so far also designed for single-user use.
We believe that allowing two or more users to participate in a single learning session could greatly increase engagement and widen the range of scenarios, 
interaction (and distraction!) possibilities. It could allow for creative roleplay within the already existing workshop, e.g. where one user plays a supervisor or visitor while another 
user must fulfil work assignments. Furthermore, it could allow supervisors or teachers to be 'present' in the workshop while a trainee performs operations. 

Experiencing the environment (including surround sound and visual effects such as flickering lights) will allow for a closer understanding and discussion of circumstances that lead 
to an injury or lapse in judgement. Of course, given a longer time frame for work would allow for a holistic integration in the apprenticeship education. 
This would mean working out a larger educative concept in which for example users would keep a log of their various injuries, spaced repetition could be employed, and 
user feedback/in-game information could be expanded. 

The standardized questionnaire we used to evaluate Avatar Embodiment was published earlier this year (2021) and highlights the significance the phenomena has in virtual reality products. 
The work is motivated by the need for standardization in measuring users' experience, inferring that so far this research has been conducted in individual experiments with varying capacities. 
The research we have found and conducted ourselves promises that avatar embodiment plays a crucial role in making VR more stimulating, engaging and immersive. 
Perhaps improvements in this area will create more comfortable, credible and enjoyable experiences for users, making the technology more accessible and attractive for mainstream use. 
The most experimental aspect of our project is creating a multisensory experience of physical injuries. Whereas for obvious reasons VR safety and hazard training is made for industrial settings, 
little research has aimed at using VR to simulate 'shocking' bodily harm for educational purposes. 
We have found research that demonstrates how users in VR will avoid virtual injuries, inferring avatar embodiment. 
However, considering the psychological implications that such experiences entail, it would be unethical to push boundaries in this aspect without professional psychological guidance. 

Besides these, the existing product still offers room for improvement. More accurate body tracking and avatar placement can improve the existing avatar embodiment experience. 
Our tasks can be designed to require more complex machine operations, ideally leading to more hectic and thus injuries. 
Our colleague-NPC can be rigged and given more realistic movement animations, thus improving its credibility as a real-life representation.

Larger milestones within the existing simulation would include further mesh manipulation (bending and filing, for example) and requested machines such as the lathe. 
Performance optimizations would allow the placement of more mirrors or other reflective surfaces throughout the workshop, which function as reinforcement of avatar embodiment 
(by allowing users to see the body they are controlling). Body/limb tracking with additional VR sensors would allow a more accurate avatar portrayal. 

Finally, creating consistently reliable physics, and ideally very accurate hand tracking would greatly improve usability across the whole application. 
Many operational steps on the machines of the workshop involve precise hand movements (tightening, holding, gripping, sliding and more), and many injuries can happen to single fingers,
from single movements. Creating this level of detail will help improve our simulation's capacity for accurately and realistically reproducing injuries.
