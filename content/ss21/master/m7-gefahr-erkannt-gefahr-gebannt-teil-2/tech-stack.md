{{<section title="Used Technologies">}}

Regarding this point we mostly stayed true to last semester's solutions.


Development
------
---


The technological foundation we continued working on is realized with the **Unity (2019.4.12f1)** game engine, expanded by the **SteamVR (1.2.3)** and the **Virtual Reality Toolkit (3.3.0)** plugins. 
For project setup and code versioning we used the same approved **GitLab self-hosted** solution as last semester.

In terms of the targeted hardware: there were internal discussions at the beginning of the semester about porting the application to a standalone, inside-out-tracking based platform like the Oculus Quest 2. 
However, from a discussion of the costs and benefits of this, we decided against the uncertainties and possibly volatile timeline it would ensue and instead focussed on enhancing the content of the experience. 
For this reason, our experience is currently still developed and targeted for the **HTC Vive VR headset**.

The modeling aspects of the work were again realized in **Blender (2.91)**, with an additional use of **ZBrush** for sculpting and texturing the user avatars.


Communication
------
---


The main internal communication channel remained **Discord**, while weekly catch up meetings with the project supervisors were held via **Zoom**.

**Miro** boards and **Google Drive** were further used for clustering and visualizing user test results as well as general organizational containers.
