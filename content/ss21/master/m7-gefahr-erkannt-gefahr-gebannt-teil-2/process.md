Continuing our project allowed us to both reflect on what we had set out to make, what we had made so far, and what we thought would most effectively bring our product further
in this second round of development. We had made a scene to work in as well as the tools and injuries that can occur from improper use. 

The following two questions kicked off the start of this new project iteration:

Question 1:
------

> How can we provoke unintentional/accidental injuries (as they are present in real workshop environments)? 



If we could answer this question, we would be pinpointing the snapshot in which human error occurs, the critical moment which can then be examined, discussed and highlighted for educational purposes. 

The approach we pursued was based on feedback we got from our partners last semester: through **distractions**. 
One of our first steps was accordingly to more clearly understand what kind of mental state workers are in when lapses in judgement, or moments of carelessness or distraction lead to injuries. 
For this, we did literature research on workplace psychology and how injuries occur, and did user research involving our industry partners. 

We found several papers that indicated factors including time pressure, environmental distractions, psychological factors such as fear of failure are among the worst culprits. 
Once we had collected this spectrum, we considered how each could be realized within our capacity, and a selection of elements emerged.

Question 2:
------

> How can we make the overall experience (especially the injuries) more impressive?


Our research around knowledge retention, immersion and experience impression continued. 
We still consider these critical to the creation of a long-lasting and memorable learning experience, and saw potential to improve our product with regard to them. 
In this research phase, we learned about **Body Ownership Illusion (BOI)**, a phenomenon where a person perceives ownership over non-bodily objects, such as artificial limbs. 
This phenomenon has been exploited in research to demonstrate how the creation of this illusion greatly enhances a user's experience in virtual reality. 
Our focus on BOI later shifted to the more narrowly defined and more applicable **Avatar Embodiment**, a term used to describe the effects of VR self-avatars on its users.

Regarding the injury depiction, we chose to maintain what we had already made, in accordance with feedback varying in tolerance towards the visual level of detail we had so far implemented.

Prototyping and First Round Testing
------
---

Given the opportunity to work with two industry partners and the fact that our test group from the first project would only be available late in the semester, 
we designed our process with two test loops. Based on our selection of new elements to incorporate, we rapidly prototyped proof-of-concept versions to be able to test 
and evaluate the elements we had made, and conducted user tests at the bfw Berlin vocational training center. 
This also allowed us to test our test-setup and gather more data on workshop distractions and injury events. 
The main new features we focused on here were the various distractions and the time-limited task intended on creating time and performance pressure. 
tested our prototype with 5 potential users, conducting interviews and documenting problems.

Improvement and Preparation for Second Round Testing
------
---

Based on the data we collected, we improved on almost all new aspects of the prototype, and added in elements that were overwhelmingly requested. 
Our distractions and user tasks were positively received by the trainers, confirming that we were moving in the right direction. 

Our preparation for the second and final user test of our prototype counted three large projects: improvement of our new elements, the realization of our user avatars, 
and how we would collect data. Within the three weeks we had, our distractions were finalized, additional tools to improve the user task were created and added, 
and we integrated two fully rigged user avatars. The test we outlined included a scientifically standardised questionnaire for Avatar Embodiment investigation, 
questions to compare returning testers' experiences (from the first semester), and specific questions related to our new features. 

Final Test
------
---

We were able to conduct 11 user tests and collect questionnaire input from 8 testers. Unfortunately, besides a single participant, 
it was not possible to test with previous users, so our comparative angle could not be used to its full potential. 
An additional misfortune was that many of the test subjects provided had never tried out virtual reality before. 
Unfortunately, we witnessed less distraction induced injuries as we had hoped for, but we have our suspicions that circumstantial factors are responsible for this. 

Nonetheless, we could collect lots of data and test with the trainers who were familiar with the project. 
Next to some points for improvement (largely regarding the user avatar, arguably the most sophisticated expansion of our original product) we received praise for 
almost all of the improvements we had made. The built in elements of time and performance pressure as well as our selection of distractions were again confirmed to 
be typical of the workshop environment and leading causes of injury.

Aftermath
------
---

Of course our final user-base test highlighted more areas of improvement, both through tester comments and developer observations. 
In the last weeks before the showtime event, our development team has been pushing hard to implement this new feedback, leading to plenty of quality of life 
improvements being added to the experience, as well as new features like an ingame avatar selection and real time marking of textures.

{{<section title="Results">}}

We set out to improve workshop safety, showing trainees what carelessness can cause, and how carelessness can be provoked. 
While all the distractions we included in our prototype are typical of workshops, we had little success in evoking accidental injuries among our test participants. 
Furthermore, many participants were so focused on completing the task that our distractions barely caused any reaction. 
At this point in the evaluation of our test results, we sat together and discussed possible influential factors to consider when interpreting the data. 
We hypothesize that this may be because of a couple different factors: many of the users were experiencing VR for the first time, we had but a single second-time user of our application, 
and on average our test pool was fairly young. Despite repeated reminders to the participants that we were in no way testing them but rather our product, some testers seemed intimidated, 
were fairly quiet, and were very careful when using the machines to create their workpieces. When we tested with two users outside of our test pool who were familiar with the team and the project, 
we observed stronger responses to our distractions. 

Perhaps the most important factor to mention is that one time use, and a single test is insufficient for the kind of product we tried to develop. 
Generally, anyone experiencing something for the first time will have a heightened awareness and attention, whereas carelessness, and the vulnerability to becoming distracted is an emergent, 
long-term state of mind - difficult to emulate in a single, 20 minute test time frame. 

From our perspective we did our best to balance effective development and the collection of valuable and interesting data against the reality that a true product requires an 
infrastructure that in our opinion is outside of the scope of this student project/our means. 
A larger and consistent user base that is regularly available, a larger development team, high powered VR kit (including precision-enhancing body and hand tracking), 
and an appropriate integration in the trainee program would allow us to go deeper.
