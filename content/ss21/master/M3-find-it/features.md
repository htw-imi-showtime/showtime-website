{{<section title="The artificial intelligence engine">}}
Our goal is to develop an **expert system capable of guessing professions by asking the user a series of questions**. This concept is inspired by the Akinator application. By traversing a dynamic tree the software automatically selects a series of questions and it also **calculates the score** of the user and **determines his job**, that will allow the artificial intelligence engine to guess as quickly as possible the most suitable professions for the user and determines the technical skills that the user has or not depending on the answers to the questions and gives an assessment. To do this, it will rely on a **knowledge base composed of 9 jobs** at the beginnging, and an **average of 54 questions**, which will be **created with our psychologist** as the rules change.

Being on a team with not only talented students but also having an actual psychologist in our rows was very helpful when it came to creating the analysis. Instead of simply putting down questions that were answered with yes or no or had the most inexpressive results to it, we were able to sit down and create a questionnaire that would directly **reflect** and **reveal** the true nature of the userâ€™s psyche. 
 
This way, our questionnaire is able to go much more in-depth when it comes to personality and competencies that are needed or the job. Instead of just matching skills in coding to the respective jobs and giving an estimate, the test captures the personality and tells the user which job he would feel the most welcome and comfortable in.

{{<section title="3D Visuals">}}
With the help of a **colorful animated 3D visualisation**, we wanted to create a **fun way to accompany the user** throughout the **four segments of the questionniare**. We wanted to create a comforting virtual bubble, in which the user can embark on the journey on finding the right place in the vast field of computer science. As the user goes through the different stages of the questionnaire, the animated character in a shape of a ball also embarks on an adventure, rolling through cheerful tubes into **rooms depicting the current stage**. The **character mirrors the user** as well as ones need to find a place in the IT industry. This is not only a joyful experience, but also serves to **follow the progress of the questionniare**.
