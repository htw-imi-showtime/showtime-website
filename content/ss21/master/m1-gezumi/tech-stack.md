#### Android & Kotlin
Android is an **open-source, Linux-based OS**, mainly developed by Google. It's **well-documented** and, next to iOsS, the most **common** operating system for mobile devices. The team decided to develop an Android App, as some existing experience could be extended and most members were Android-device users.

Kotlin is a fairly **modern programming language** inspired by Java. It is clean, carries **fewer formalities** and is therefore shorter than Java. In 2019 Google declared Kotlin the preferred language for Android.

#### GitHub/Git
GitHub was used to host the code as well as for the project management, which lead to a **highly efficient, collaborative workflow**.

The development process was organized in **one-week sprints** with self-contained feature releases and briefings with the project supervisor every second week. In weekly sprint meetings, all team members were brought up to date and new goals for the following sprint were defined. In order to improve the collaboration as a team, retrospectives were set up as needed. During those retrospectives, both conflicts and achievements were addressed.

Due to the need for social distancing, the complete workflow and all interactions were organized online. Towards the end of the predetermined project time, when personal get-togethers became possible and necessary, in-person meetings were slowly introduced into the flow.


#### Miro
Miro was used for **visualizing our ideas and brainstorming**.

#### WhatsApp/Zoom
**Zoom** held the team's **pair/mob programming sessions** as well as **meetings** with the **project supervisor**. For shorter messages and quick discussions, **WhatsApp** became the main communication tool.
