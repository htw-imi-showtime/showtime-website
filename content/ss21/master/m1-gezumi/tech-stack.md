#### Android & Kotlin
Android is an **open-source, Linux-based OS**, mainly developed by Google. It's **well-documented** and, next to iOS, the most **common** operating system for mobile devices. The team decided to develop an Android App, as some existing experience could be extended and most members were Android-device users.

Kotlin is a fairly **modern programming language** inspired by Java. It is clean, carries **fewer formalities** and is therefore shorter than Java. In 2019 Google declared Kotlin the preferred language for Android.

As all team members were eager to expand their skill-set with a new programming language, the decision was made to ‘jump in at the deep end’ and fully develop the Android App in Kotlin.

#### Bluetooth Low Energy

As Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) allowed for both a broadcasting approach and client-server-communication, the decision to use BLE instead of the ‘classic’ Bluetooth standard was quickly made.

Common with all modern technologies and tech stacks, using a newer approach inherently comes with a smaller knowledge base, due to the limited amount of ‘users’. This frequently lead to issues, as exemplary code was difficult to find, even though the basic Google documentation was quite extensive.

#### GitHub
GitHub was used to host the code as well as for the project management, which lead to a **highly efficient, collaborative workflow**.

Using Github Actions a **CI/CD pipeline** was implemented.
 It ensures a high code quality and builds an apk which is then released on Github.

#### Miro & Figma
Miro was used for **visualizing our ideas and brainstorming**.
The final designs were created using Figma. 

#### Zoom
**Zoom** held the team's **pair/mob programming sessions** as well as **meetings** with the **project supervisor**. For shorter messages and quick discussions, **WhatsApp** became the main communication tool.
