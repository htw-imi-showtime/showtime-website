GeZuMi can be seen as a **Proof of Concept**. The goal was to determine whether distances could be **reliably calculated** and then further processed with **Bluetooth** technologies. Overall, there are **technical limitations** to the Bluetooth concept and it is not perfect for determining real time locations.

To reliably work with the transmitted data, the **filtering of the RSSI values** would have to become more precise so that the unexpected **spikes and drops** of the values could be balanced out.

#### Increased count of Players per Game
Ideally, with an improvement in distance and position calculation, **more than three players** should be able to join a game. The implementation of this feature would also include an **improved generation of target shapes**, to avoid having a random collection of edges and lines.

#### Gamification
In the future, more gamification features will be included in the game. To incentivize more games, overall **highscore lists** are planned. This would allow players to compare their own group with the skills and speed of others and, hopefully, increase the team's motivation.

Different types of **levels or game modes** are also in planning. One version would be to have a **predefined game time**, of 60 seconds for example, with the objective of matching **as many target shapes as possible**. Another alternative is the '**blind mode**'. In this game mode, only one player would see the target shape. They then need to quickly and clearly direct their teammates to their target positions.
