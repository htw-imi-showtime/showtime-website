{{<section title="Workflow">}}
The development process was split into one-week sprints, with a self-contained feature release and briefing with the project supervisor every other week. In weekly sprint meetings headed all team members were brought up to date and new goals were set for the upcoming sprint. 

For pair programming, brainstorming or researching the team met in smaller sub-groups based on who was working on the respective task. To improve collaboration as a team and reflect on conflicts and impediments, a retrospective was organized whenever the need arose.

Due to the social distancing regulations, the process was fully organized through digital meetings. Toward the end of the project's time-frame, in-person meetings became possible again and were used to focus on specific challenges and to prepare the show-time.

### Kotlin
Kotlin is a fairly modern programming language inspired by Java. It is clean, carries fewer formalities and is therefore shorter than Java. In 2019 Google declared Kotlin the preferred language for Android.

As all team members were eager to expand their skill-set with a new programming language, the decision was made to 'jump in at the deep end' and fully develop the Android App in Kotlin.

### Bluetooth Standard Decision
<!-- TODO Flo / Samuel: Entscheidungsprozess fuer BLE -->
As Bluetooth Low Energy allowed for both a broadcasting approach and client-server-communication, the decision to use BLE instead of the 'classic' Bluetooth standard was quickly made.

Common with all modern technologies and tech stacks, using a newer approach inherently comes with a smaller knowledge base, due to the limited amount of 'users'. This frequently lead to issues, as exemplary code was difficult to find, even though the basic Google documentation was quite extensive.


### Data 'Cleanup'
