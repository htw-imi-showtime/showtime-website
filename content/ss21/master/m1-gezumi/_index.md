card_description = "GeZuMi is an Android App reminiscent of team building exercises. Ideally played outside, the players' goal is to quickly reproduce a geometric shape (e.g. a Triangle) dictated by the app. This is done through a BLE connection, a lot of of communication and a good amount of Math."

{{<section title="The Objective">}}
**Ge**ometrie**Zu**m**Mi**tnehmen (GeZuMi) was created with the objective of testing the **boundaries and possibilites of Bluetooth** technologies in mind. The ideal outcome of the project was to be a fully functional application that would allow an **unspecified number of players (n)** to play a game that would display a **geometric shape with n sides and corners** that the users would then **reproduce in real life**. Everyone involved in the project was aware from the beginning that the objective might not be obtainable due to technical constraints.

{{<section title="Our Goals">}}
To achieve the overall objective, the following basic milestones and goals that were to be completed within the timeframe of project were defined.
- **Bluetooth standard** decision: 'classic' Bluetooth vs BLE
- Geometric **shape generation**
- **Player localization** based on Bluetooth signal strength
- **Gamification** features

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The team was made up of five people with diverse development backgrounds. Before the start of the project, only two of the five had actively worked on an Android App and Bluetooth development. To improve efficiency and speed, we split into two main focal points: One was setting up and ensuring a stable Bluetooth connection whereas the other dealt more heavily with the Mathematical aspects of the project.
