{{<section title="Tech Stack">}}
MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js und Node.js) as the tech stack had been decided upon before the project started. The study program is increasingly using more modern JavaScript-based frameworks and the IMI-Map was supposed to become more easily integrable into other courses and student projects. Here are the components of MEVN:

**[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**
* a document based database which we used with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

**[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**
* a JavaScript web framework - used for programming the API

**[Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/)**
* a JavaScript framework for frontend development - we took a chance and went with the new version of Vue.js as to make it more future proof

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
* a JavaScript-Runtime

{{<section title="Development Tools">}}
Which tools we were using as a team to work was our decision. These were the tools we mainly used:

**GitHub/git**
* GitHub Projects for keeping track of issues and progress
* Milestones for keeping track of user stories
* Issues for keeping track of tasks
* Version control

**Miro**
* Documentation of decisions
* Visualisation of processes and ideas

**Discord**
* Communication while working on the project
* Weekly team meetings

**Telegram**
* Urgent communication
