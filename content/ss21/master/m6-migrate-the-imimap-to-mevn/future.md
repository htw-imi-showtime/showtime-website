With this version of the IMI-Map we have achieved a significant improvement over the previous version. We sincerely hope the long tradition of student projects and thesis will continue and further generations of IMIs will continue maintaining and improving the IMI-Map.

And we already have a few ideas:

{{<section title="Future Ideas">}}
**Review Processes**

The idea for a possibility of reviewing internships in the IMI-Map has been around since before our project. It has come up during our project as well before it became clear that it would fall outside the scope of this project.

Students could be asked to review their internships according to certain criteria. Other students that are looking for internships using the IMI-Map could then get more information about the placement and the experience and make a more informed decision.

**PDF Parsing**

Because the IMI-Map can now handle all the required PDF-documents, these documents could be parsed for information. For example:
* Once the contract is uploaded it could be parsed for information, so the student does not have to enter place of work, working hours and salary themselves.
* Once the student uploaded the grade transcript there could be an automatic check to see whether the student has completed all the required courses or not. That way the internship officer does not have to check this manually.

**LSF Connection**

The student could grant the IMI-Map access to their grade transcript via LSF directly. This would eliminate the need for the student to download their grade transcript from LSF and then upload it again into the IMI-Map. Additionally, the administrator could see more easily whether the course accompanying the internship (AEP) has been passed.


**Login via SAML**

The login could be changed to use SAML instead of LDAP, so the users of the IMI-Map don't have to give their HTW-Password to the IMI-Map but can sign on via the HTW sign on service.
