{{<section title="Gathering Information">}}
First, the team needed to gather information about the internship administration process and the changes that hat been made to it due to the COVID19-Pandemic. To do this we repeated the following three steps:
* Talk to previous and current internship officers and the student assistants in the internship administration.
* Understand and visualize the process.
* Talk about the visualisations and make adjustments accordingly.

{{<section title="What to keep?">}}
The next step was to evaluate the current IMI-Map and to decide what to keep and what to toss out. Due to the IMI-Map having an 8-year history there were a lot of relics of past ideas. Over the years there had also been a lot of additions to the IMI-Map and not a lot of cleaning up grown-out-of-hand models or unused features.

We ended up keeping all of the main features of the old IMI-Map. Amongst other things we tossed out old attempts on review processes and decided to redesign the models completely.

{{<section title="What to add?">}}
Now we needed to decide if we wanted to add anything. Talking to the internship officer and the student assistants gave us a lot of ideas what could be improved. We landed on:
* Implementing the handling of all the required PDFs using the IMI-Map to make the internship administration process more seamless.
* Using [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) to be able to keep an administration history of internships and also to de-clutter the internship model a lot because it didn't have to save the states of each of its components. Event Sourcing would take care of that.
* Designing a new admin interface including quick actions and more to make the internship administration process faster and less tedious.
* Redesigning the models that had grown and developed over the years to be huge.

{{<section title="Rewriting">}}
After the concept was done we started implementing. We started working on frontend and backend separately. Simultaneously we worked on a deployment process and on a login strategy.

Once we had finished frontend and backend we connected them with an API and added Cypress tests.

{{<section title="Obstacles">}}
The biggest obstacle in this project was the concept and implementation of [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html). We spent a lot of time defining which events we would need and how exactly they could be implemented to best depict the process ot the internship administration.

As cheesy as it sounds: We solved this obstacle using teamwork. After we could not solve this as individual team members we spent a lot of time together as a whole group discussing the events and their implementation until we landed on a version which we all thought was logical and also practical.
