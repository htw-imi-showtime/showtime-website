* <strong>Ableton Live</strong><br>
Live was our main tool for composing the game score as well as creating the MIDI files that are used to drive rhythmic gameplay.
* <strong>MaxMSP & Max4Live</strong><br>
We used Max to build a translation layer that would convert musical cues to usable gampeplay events. The tight integration of Max into Live via Max4Live made it easy to do quick iterations of the gameplay.
