{{<section title="First things first">}}
Every project has a beginning and an end. Before we started doing anything, we were discussing possible ideas for a project. We had to do something with the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? In the beginning we had a lot of questions and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro Board. Almost weekly more notes were added to the Board.

We discussed a lot of ideas and we decided that each team member has to create a small digital prototype with their ideas. One idea was to create something that can be played with a VR headset. Another idea was to have the player in a blood stream that destroys approaching viruses. We were all very taken with both ideas. We thought it will fit perfectly together. Nevertheless, we had the feeling that something was missing. Music! We need music!

Our focus was to create the various assets ourselves - at least for the most part. This point was very important for us, because self-created assets give the project more independence. We can say and point out that what you are seeing in the game, we created (nearly) everything ourselves.
