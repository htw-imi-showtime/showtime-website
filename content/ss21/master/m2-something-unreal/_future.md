{{<section title="Many ideas, too little time">}}
We had many ideas for the creation of new levels and features for <strong>Something Unreal</strong>. Unfortunately, we were only able to put a very small number of these ideas into practice in the short time available.
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Extension possibilities of Something Unreal">}}
*  Unlimited number of further levels e.g. a space level or city level
*  Inclusion of a level editor so that the players themselves can determine the music in the levels
*  Expansion with boss fights

{{<section title="Bug fixes and improvements">}}
Performance improvements, e.g. through low poly meshes (partly already implemented)
