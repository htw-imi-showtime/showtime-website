{{<section title="Our goal">}}
Our goal for the project was to create an audiovisual experience for VR headsets. The gameplay is very rhytmic and strongly tied to the music. We used the strengths of <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> and its <i>Blueprint Visual Scripting System</i> and combined our various skills within the team to create <strong>Something Unreal</strong>.
