In addition to red and white blood cells, there are also coronaviruses in the blood that need to be smashed. By smashing the viruses, the music running in the background is supported with sounds. But watch out! The player should beware of the mean fatty tissue, which tries to influence the player's vision."

{{<section title="Our goal">}}
Our goal for the project was to create an audio visual experience that can be experienced and played with a VR headset only. We used the strengths of the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> and it's <i>Blueprint-Visual-Scripting-System</i> and combined our various skills within the team to create <strong>Something Unreal</strong>.
