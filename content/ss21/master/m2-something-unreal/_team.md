{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of various personalities, ages, experience and knowledge. We all came together to work on the project <strong>Something Unreal</strong>. Despite diversity, there is one thing that unites us all - our love for video games and new technologies.<br><br>
In the beginning, everyone shared their preferences on what they would like to contribute to the project. Some wanted to gain new experiences, while others wanted to do what they are good at. One of our significant strengths was communication and motivation. We met weekly online via Discord and Zoom and shared our current status with the team.<br><br>
Jördis was responsible for all particle systems. Till took over the creation of textures, level design and video editing. Dominic built various assets, animated the hands and took care of this website. Tony was responsible for programming the game logic and Ralf took over the role as our team leader, audio guru, programmer and tied everything together.
