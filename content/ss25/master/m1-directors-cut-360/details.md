#### Desktop GUI
We created a the graphical inteface with QTs by using PySide. It features a sidebar, video controlls and different views to analyze the saliency.

#### Views Options
In the app you have the options between different views. Under the videos you can view a Map that represent if the view direction mateches the directors cut or view the saliency map for the current frame. It is also possible to display the saliency and the directors cut as an overlay on the video.

#### Predictors
Choose between different predictors algorithms: Choose between fast or slower but more accurates algorithms.

#### Highlight Brush
Use the spotlight brush to brigthen a spot in the video and see the effects on re-predictions.
