abstract = "This e-learning unit is designed for first-semester international students of the Media Informatics Bachelor’s program at HTW Berlin. It teaches the fundamentals of Java programming in a creative and engaging way. Instead of traditional, dry exercises, students are guided through a magical storyline where programming concepts are explained using potions, magical capes, wands, and other fantasy elements. To ensure long-term usability, all learning content is managed via a connected headless CMS, allowing professors and students to adapt and expand the platform beyond the semester. Combined with a custom visual design theme, this e-learning unit offers a flexible, fun, and didactically meaningful approach to learning programming."

**What we built: A magical e-learning platform for Java beginners**

Our product is an interactive e-learning platform that teaches Java fundamentals to first-semester Media Informatics students at HTW Berlin. But instead of a plain course structure, we embedded the learning material into a fantasy-themed world, where learners become digital wizards and witches on a quest to master Java spells.

Key programming concepts like variables, objects and classes are introduced using storytelling elements — for example, objects are magical potions that can be created, classes are magical wands that can be transformed with its methods. We believe that this imaginative approach makes learning less intimidating and more memorable for beginners.

The content is delivered through a modular web app based on Nuxt.js connected to the headless CMS Strapi. This allows professors to update or expand the learning content without touching the codebase. Instructors can even tailor content to specific cohorts or semesters — all through the CMS.

We also designed a consistent visual identity for the course, complete with a magical UI theme to match the narrative.

{{<section title="Process">}}
We started by building on concepts developed during a previous course on media didactics, aiming to create an engaging e-learning unit for first-semester international students.

After prototyping and iterating on our ideas, we implemented the unit using Nuxt.js and Strapi, with a focus on modular, interactive content.

Along the way, we overcame challenges in deployment, backend structure, and data integration—working as a team with complementary strengths in frontend, backend, and content development.{{</section>}}

**What makes this approach different**

* **A story-first mindset**  
  Unlike many tutorials that jump right into syntax, our course wraps every lesson in a fictional scenario. This context boosts motivation and improves knowledge retention.

* **Interactive, CMS-driven content**  
  All tasks, explanations, and story dialogues are editable through the CMS. This allows instructors to keep content fresh or localize it for different language levels and cultural backgrounds. It also ensures that future semesters can build on the platform easily.

* **Prepared for future expansion**  
  The system is scalable: new chapters, themes (e.g. a chapter about loops), and difficulty levels can be added with minimal developer effort. The CMS-first approach ensures long-term usability across cohorts and contexts.
