#### A magical e-learning platform for Java beginners

Our product is an interactive e-learning platform that teaches the fundamentals of programming with Java.

Key programming concepts like variables, objects and classes are introduced using storytelling elements — objects are magical potions that can be created, classes are magical wands that can be transformed with its methods. We believe that this imaginative approach makes learning less intimidating and more memorable for beginners.

The content is delivered through a modular web app based on Nuxt.js connected to the headless CMS Strapi. This allows professors to update or expand the learning content without touching the codebase. Instructors can even tailor content to specific cohorts or semesters — all through the CMS.

{{<section title="Process">}}
We started by building on concepts developed during a previous course on media didactics, aiming to create an engaging e-learning unit for first-semester students.

After prototyping and iterating on our ideas, we implemented the unit using Nuxt.js and Strapi, with a focus on modular, interactive content.

Along the way, we overcame challenges in deployment, backend structure, and data integration - working as a team with complementary strengths in frontend, backend, and content development.{{</section>}}

#### What makes this approach different

##### A story-first mindset
  Unlike many tutorials that jump right into syntax, our course wraps every lesson in a fictional scenario. This context boosts motivation and improves knowledge retention.

##### Interactive, CMS-driven content
  All tasks, explanations, and story dialogues are editable through the CMS. This allows instructors to keep content fresh or localize it for different language levels. It also ensures that future semesters can build on the platform easily.

##### Prepared for future expansion
  The system is scalable: new chapters, themes (e.g. a chapter about loops), and difficulty levels can be added with minimal developer effort. The CMS-first approach ensures long-term usability across cohorts and contexts.
