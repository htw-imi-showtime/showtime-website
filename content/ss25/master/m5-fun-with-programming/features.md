{{<section title="General">}}
This e-learning unit is designed for first-semester international students of the Media Informatics Bachelor’s program at HTW Berlin. It teaches the fundamentals of Java programming in a creative and engaging way. Instead of traditional, dry exercises, students are guided through a magical storyline where programming concepts are explained using potions, magical capes, wands, and other fantasy elements. To ensure long-term usability, all learning content is managed via a connected headless CMS, allowing professors and students to adapt and expand the platform beyond the semester. Combined with a custom visual design theme, this e-learning unit offers a flexible, fun, and didactically meaningful approach to learning programming.

{{<section title="Different lecture elements">}}
Each lecture within the e-learning unit combines various content elements to create an engaging and interactive learning experience. In addition to text, audio, video, and images, learners can also encounter a variety of exercises. These include coding tasks, cloze tests, line-marking activities, multiple-choice questions, and many other interactive components—all easily manageable through the CMS platform.

{{<section title="Java code compiler">}}
To go beyond simple string comparisons and make the coding exercises more engaging, we integrated a Java compiler into the platform. This compiler runs in a separate Docker container and communicates with the application whenever code is submitted.{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Content management manual">}}
With a manual for content creation, instructors can easily adapt and expand the learning content without having to touch the codebase.<br>
