This e-learning unit is designed for first-semester international students of the Media Informatics Bachelorâ€™s program at HTW Berlin. It teaches the fundamentals of Java programming in a creative and engaging way. Instead of traditional, dry exercises, students are guided through a magical storyline where programming concepts are explained using potions, magical capes, wands, and other fantasy elements. To ensure long-term usability, all learning content is managed via a connected headless CMS, allowing professors and students to adapt and expand the platform beyond the semester. Combined with a custom visual design theme, this e-learning unit offers a flexible, fun, and didactically meaningful approach to learning programming.
