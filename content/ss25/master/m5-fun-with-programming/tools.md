{{<section title="Concept & Design">}}
[Miro](https://miro.com/)<br>
Miro was used for the initial brainstorming sessions, for concretizing the requirements and concept. We used it as well for the first low-fidelity prototypes. It allowed the team to discuss and visualize ideas and record decisions.

[Figma](https://figma.com/)<br>
Figma was used to create the UI component library, style guide and final design for the user interface of Javacademy.

{{<section title="Development">}}
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)<br>
Nuxt is a powerful Vue.js framework that simplifies the development of web applications by providing a nice-to-handle directory structure, server-side rendering, routing functionalities and other built-in features.

By harnessing Nuxt, the team was able to create reusable UI components, accelerate development speed, and deliver a modern and intuitive web application, enhancing the overall user experience.

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)<br>
JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that enables the development of interactive and dynamic web applications.

[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)<br>
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript and introduces static typing. With TypeScript, errors can be caught early during development, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)<br>
Tailwind CSS is a preferred utility-first CSS framework for building stylish and responsive user interfaces. By providing a comprehensive set of low-level utilities, it makes it easy to create and customise consistent, visually appealing UI components, and enhances the overall efficiency of the development process.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)<br>
Vite is used as a modern build tool and development server that significantly enhances the web development workflow. Vite's fast development server with instant hot module replacement enables rapid iteration and provides quick feedback during the development process. Its efficient build process, leveraging native ES modules for production, leads to optimised and high-performance web applications.

[Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev)<br>
Pinia is a modern and lightweight alternative to Vuex for Vue 3. It provides a simple and intuitive API for managing the state of the application, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications.

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)<br>
Strapi is a headless CMS that provides a user-friendly interface for managing content, providing a robust solution for managing and updating the content of the application. It is the technology that we have used for our backend coming out of the box already with user management functionalities.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br>
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package and run applications in isolated environments, making it easier to deploy and manage applications. For the deployment of Strapi and the MySQL we coordinated with the HTW Rechenzentrum to use an HTW server.

[MySQL](http://mysql.com/de/)<br>
MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage data for web applications. We used it in combination with Strapi and Docker.

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com)<br>
GitLab served as the chosen platform for managing the project's codebase, with both a repository for the backend and the frontend. The built-in Kanban feature helped to create tickets and keep track of todos. We were able to create a group in Gitlab hosting all our repositories in one place in coordination with the HTW Rechenzentrum.
