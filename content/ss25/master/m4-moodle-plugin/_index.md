{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Our primary aim is to gather reliable data from students on their perception of learning materials in order to refine them and enhance teaching methods. We achieve this by using a quick and unobtrusive feedback system in Moodle tests, which makes it easy for students to contribute without feeling overwhelmed. The reason for this is to create a valuable dataset for teachers, helping them to identify the questions that challenge students the most. Seamlessly integrating with Moodle, our plugin benefits not only our stakeholders, but all Moodle users too, paving the way for more effective teaching and improved course design.

{{<section title="Process and Outcome">}}
To make our idea work within Moodle’s structure, we investigated how its plugins interacted with each other. After conducting some research, we realised that we needed to develop three plugins to fit this structure. One allows students to rate the difficulty of a question receiving feedback for the content of their answer immediately. The second plugin allows students to rate the difficulty of a question without the immediate provision of feedback on the content. Therefore teachers can choose what kind of test settings make more sense to them didactically, while still receiving difficulty ratings. The third plugin gives teachers access to all the collected feedback. This setup makes it easy to gather meaningful student feedback, which teachers can then easily export from Moodle for their own use.

{{<section title="Team">}}
Our team consists of five students, who equally contributed to our project. The team was divided into groups, with each group focusing on a different plugin. This approach ensured a robust and effective solution.
