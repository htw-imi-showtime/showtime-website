Dolly’s House is a puzzle-horror game that experiments with different lighting and rendering techniques to create an atmospheric and dark experience. It is set to test the limitations of what is possible to create using light in a game-engine."

{{<section title="Goals">}}
"It has to be cool." - this is the standard we were set to fulfill.

Thus, we did not just use light to make the game visually appealing, but also
centered a huge amount of gameplay around utilizing light. One of our main priorities
was challenging players with puzzles that use different light mechanics in diverse
ways. For instance, to light up a completely dark room or by coloring objects with the
help of RGB-colored spotlights. To achieve our goals, we used the Unity Game
Engine as well as its build in HDRP Render-Pipeline.

{{<section title="Development">}}
We had the idea, way before the semester began. The development started after we
were officially put together into a team of seven.
During development, we utilized weekly meetings to organize the team and
upcoming tasks. These meetings helped us to get to know each other and discuss
the game's current status. Additionally, we had one extra weekly meeting with Prof.
Lenz to show him our current progress. There he was able to stress-test the game
and find missing game-mechanics as well as all absent object-colliders. (He is
phenomenal at this!) We used these insights to plan and distribute our weekly goals
and tasks.

We divided our team into two sub-groups: art and programming. The art team was
tasked with creating concept art, assets, model, textures, materials and laying out as
well as designing levels. Meanwhile, the programming team was responsible for
implementing AI, level loading systems, and core game logic. However, these roles
were flexible - team members were encouraged to collaborate across teams with
one another and to test out different design-approaches. This allowed programmers
to contribute to art tasks and artists to support programming when needed.
Due to the topic of our game being "light and shadows" we spend a lot of time testing
out different light-setups inside Unity's virtual environment. In addition, we modelled
and textured many of the game's assets ourselves to better fit the overall
atmosphere we created.

{{<section title="Meet the Team">}}

We are a team of seven highly motivated IMI-Students. Our backgrounds are as
diverse as our personalities and passions: While some of us are very fond of art,
others are purely interested in the technical side. But what unites us is our shared
passion for game development and interactive story-telling.


**Farel Alfarizi Hasan**

*"Can anyone remind me again to fix the texture error Winston told me to fix 15 commits ago?"*

**Jessica Wiecha**

*"The rig behaves normally... until midnight."*

**Kartik Kushwaha**

*"Designed the levels, so you regret every step."*

**Linh Vuong**

*"I love it when the most irrelevant asset just casually has over 2 million vertexes."*

**Max**

*"These bugs keep appearing and I am starting to run out of bug spray..."*

**Malte Szemlics**

*"Every time I fix the mesh, three new problems spawn. It's like hydra, but for edge loops."*

*"Hi, I'm Winston. They call me the 'Triangle Police'."*
