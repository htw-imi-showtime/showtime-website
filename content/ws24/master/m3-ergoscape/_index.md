{{<section title="Abstract">}}
Achieve the most accurate results in spiroergometry tests by keeping participants motivated right up to their true physical limits. ErgoScape transforms the test into an immersive experience, combining dynamic visuals, real-time performance data, and well-timed verbal encouragement.

{{<section title="What is Spiroergometry?">}}
Spiroergometry is a specialized test that measures how efficiently your body takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide during exercise. It can be used to diagnose various medical conditions, such as heart and lung diseases, and to determine the fitness level of a person. Typically, participants must push themselves to the brink of exhaustion for the results to be accurate — something that’s often easier said than done.

{{<section title="Our Goal">}} 
The foundation of our project was provided by the Institute of Sports Science at the University of Bern. They believe that audiovisual stimuli can significantly improve the performance of participants during spiroergometry tests by motivating them to push themselves to their true physical limits. We wanted to create a software tool that would enhance the test experience by providing an immersive and engaging environment that would motivate participants to give their best. The goal was to develop a tool that could also be used to conduct studies to investigate the effects of different motivational elements and audiovisual stimuli on the performance of participants during spiroergometry tests.

{{<section title="Main Ideas">}}
In Order to achieve this, ErgoScape immerses participants in a virtual cycling experience. The software uses live data from the spiroergometry test to adjust the simulation. This way, participants feel like they are really cycling along the track. Additionally, live performance data is displayed on the screen to give participants feedback on their progress and motivate them to push themselves to their limits. Verbal encouragement is provided at key moments to keep participants motivated right up to their true physical limits.

Because doctors might not be as tech-savvy as we are, ErgoScape was designed to be as user-friendly as possible while still allowing the flexibility needed to adapt to every tester's individual needs: You can seamlessly configure the test on one device and run the corresponding simulation on another - or both on the same device. Whatever suits your needs best.

To explore the effects of different motivational elements and audiovisual stimuli on the performance of participants during spiroergometry tests, ErgoScape allows you to easily customize the motivational elements and audiovisual stimuli in the simulation. This way, you can conduct studies to investigate which elements work best in motivating participants to give their best.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
ErgoScape's team structure was highly dynamic from the get-go: Initially, all team members participated in research and concept development. As the project progressed, we distributed tasks according to individual strengths and interests, while making sure that everyone still had a basic understanding of the entire project. This approach allowed us to work efficiently and effectively, ensuring that all team members were able to contribute to the project's success.
