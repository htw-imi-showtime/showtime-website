{{<section title="Immersive Cycling Experience">}}
ErgoScape immerses participants in a virtual cycling experience. The application uses first-person cycling videos while adjusting the playing speed based on the live data from the spiroergometry test and enriching the experience with additional visual effects and motivational elements like progress bars and verbal encouragement.

{{<section title="Live Data Integration">}}
During the spiroergometry test, a lot of medical data, such as heart rate, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production, is collected by the MetaSoft Studio software. ErgoScape reads this data in real-time by taking a live screencapture of the MetaSoft Studio window and using OCR to read the data from the screen. This data is then used to adjust the simulation and to display live performance data on the screen.

{{<section title="User-Friendly Configuration">}}
The test can be easily customised for each session's individual needs. You want to turn the verbal encouragement off because you want to test the effect of the visual elements only? No problem. You can select the exact motivational elements you want to use and configure the simulation to your liking.
