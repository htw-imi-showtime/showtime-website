The project began with brainstorming sessions, where we explored various ideas, including NPC-based games and AI assistants. After gathering insights from online resources and real-world applications, we decided to merge AI with an immersive travel experience. In the Requirement Analysis phase, we defined the user needs and project goals, ensuring that the platform would offer personalized travel recommendations and seamless interaction. Moving to Design and Prototyping, we created system architecture and UI designs that would provide users with a smooth and intuitive experience.

In the API Integration phase, we connected to Amadeus AI for real-time flight and hotel data, and integrated speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities using Vosk and Python TTS. This made the platform interactive, providing voice-driven assistance for travel planning. During the Development stage, we coded the system using Unity (C#) for the front end and Python for backend functionalities. Weekly team meetings played a critical role here, where we discussed progress, addressed challenges, and explored solutions together.

After setting up the project framework and completing the code for each component, we needed to integrate Python and Unity. To achieve this, we used sockets and a server to enable communication between the two. Once we had a functioning program, we proceeded with addressing minor bugs and refining features to improve the overall functionality. This iterative process continued as we worked towards a stable, fully deployed version of the system.
