HoloCMS is a mixed reality app for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 that lets users scan custom QR codes to view dynamic content from a web based content management system (CMS) in augmented reality (AR). Developed for the Research and Education Center for Culture and Information Technology (FKI), HoloCMS allows users to explore points of interest enriched with visual and interactive displays. 

{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
The main goal of HoloCMS is to create an interactive and user friendly platform that leverages AR for educational and cultural experiences. By combining QR code technology with the Microsoft HoloLens 2, we aim to offer an immersive way for users to discover and explore detailed information intuitively.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of three ambitious students from the International Media and Computing program and currently in the fifth semester of our Bachelor's degree. Without any experience  in developing for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 or using Unity prior to this project, we embraced the challenge and brought HoloCMS to life through innovative thinking, great teamwork and clever solutions.
