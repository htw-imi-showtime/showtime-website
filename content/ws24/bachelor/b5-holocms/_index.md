{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of three ambitious students from the International Media and Computing program and currently in the fifth semester of our Bachelor's degree. Without any experience  in developing for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 or using Unity prior to this project, we embraced the challenge and brought HoloCMS to life through innovative thinking, great teamwork and clever solutions.
