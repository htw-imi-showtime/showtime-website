* **Issue:** 
The project idea was presented to us by the Berlin Fire Department,
who outlined the main problems with the official website, especially
with its confusing layout and difficulty for applicants to find the
apprenticeship that would suit them.
* **Solution:**
We resolved to improve their career page and spent a lot of time
conceptualising a new home page, a new page listing all career
opportunities, and a quiz for applicants to figure out which 
apprenticeship path suits them.

* **What we built:**
The end result is a complete career website built with Next.js, a 
React framework that allows for speedy generation of websites so 
we could see what we were building live.
