Starting B3 - Berliner Feuerwehr: Helm Sucht Kopf, we began by analyzing the current fire
department website to pinpoint its pain points and areas for improvement. Our key questions
were: What’s not working? What could be improved? And how can we create solutions that
meet the needs of users, stakeholders, and us?

To better understand user behavior, we examined website statistics provided by the fire
department, such as time spent on various pages and points of disengagement. Additionally, we
conducted a survey with 16 individuals who had applied within the last four years. We asked
them about the challenges they faced, their motivations, and their suggestions for improvement.
This survey allowed us to connect more closely with the applicants perspectives and gain a
deeper understanding of the problem. The more thoroughly we understand an issue, the easier
it becomes to solve.

With this foundation, we brainstormed ideas for the website that balanced creativity and
practicality. Our goal was to create something engaging yet realistic to implement within the
project’s timeframe. Deciding on the final features was one of the most challenging parts of the
process—so many great ideas, yet so little time! After thorough discussion and feedback from
the fire department, we ultimately settled on four main features.

Working on this project also meant diving deep into the different entry opportunities at the fire
department. Fortunately, the fire department provided us with all the information we needed.
Once the features were decided, we moved on to implementation. As a team of seven, we
divided into smaller groups, made weekly and bi-weekly sprints with each group focusing on
one or two features. This approach allowed us to work efficiently and tackle multiple aspects
simultaneously.

Throughout the process, communication was critical. Regular updates, collaborative
problem-solving, and a shared commitment kept the team aligned and motivated. The project
coincided with holidays and exam season, which added pressure, but our teamwork and
determination helped us overcome these challenges. We are proud to present the results of our
hard work.
