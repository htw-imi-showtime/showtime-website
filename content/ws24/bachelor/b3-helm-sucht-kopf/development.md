We started by analyzing the fire department’s website to spot issues and areas for improvement. Using website stats and feedback from 16 recent applicants, we gained insights into user needs and challenges.

With this foundation, we brainstormed and prioritized creative yet practical ideas. After discussions with the fire department, we finalized four main features.

Our team of seven worked in smaller groups, using sprints to stay organized and tackle tasks efficiently. Despite juggling holidays and exams, strong communication and teamwork kept us on track.

We’re proud to share the results of our hard work\!
