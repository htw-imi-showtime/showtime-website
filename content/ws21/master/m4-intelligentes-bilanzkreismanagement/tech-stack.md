#### Amazon AWS
During the early stages of our project we agreed that we want to run the application as costefficient, scalable and performant as possible. We therefore decided to build the system on a serverless architecture
using **[Amazon AWS Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lambda/)**. The lambda functions only run when they are called through their individual endpoints and provide the latest forecast data generated by the power consumption machine learning models.
This reduces the amount of computing power and completely avoids any fixcosts required to run the application.
The forecast data, as well as the entire frontend are stored on **[AWS S3 Buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/de/s3/)**.
The AWS environment enables us to add more resources like databases or mediastorage as required and when required.

#### Expressjs
For our backend API that runs on AWS Lambda we used **[Express](https://expressjs.com/de/)** to build the http endpoint for the lambda function.

#### React (Typescript) + Tailwind Css
Our frontend is built on **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** which helped us to reduce bugs and unpredictable errors during development.
Typescript also makes it easier for future developers working on the project to dive into and understand the code and how our components work.
Using **[Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/)** and its utility first approach, we were able to build new components for our dashboard without having to spend too much time structuring our Css and thinking about methodlogies like **[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)**.

#### Gitlab
For hosting and versioning our code we used **Gitlab** which was provided by Exxeta.

Our CI/CD pipeline was built using **Gitlab CI** and includes a test stage, running when feature branches are merged into our development branch.
Whenever we completed a user story we merged our changes into our main branch which then triggers the build and deployment stage, building the application and deploying it onto the AWS S3 Bucket.

#### Testing
For test automation we included **[Cypress tests](https://www.cypress.io/)** in our project.

#### Jira & Scrum
Our entire design and development process was strictly based on the **Scrum framework**. **Jira** helped us to manage our project and sprints.

#### Miro & Figma
For brainstorming, making notes during user interviews as well as tests, retros and meeting protocols we used **Miro**.
Our entire design was created using **Figma**.

#### Discord & Microsoft Teams
For internal meetings we used **Discord**, for external meetings with Exxeta and other stakeholders we used **Microsoft Teams**.

#### After Effects & Loom
For our final presentation video we used After Effects for animation and Loom to record screencasts.
