{{<section title="The Objective">}}
VR hardware such as the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift allows the user to manipulate virtual spaces and handle virtual objects. However, when implementing real-world objects in Virtual Reality these techniques lack the ability to represent the objects weight and haptic properties, thus detracting from the immersion of the VR experience. In certain scenarios it is useful to have real haptic feedback of an object to interact with them in virtual worlds.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of four developers coming from different countries and areas of expertise, combining knowledge in game development, data visualization and virtual reality. Everybody in the team had already worked in Unity and has access to a head mounted display. All of us are interested in the future of VR and possible ussages for it, so everyone was motivated to create an intuitive interface for exploring global data in an immersive environment.
