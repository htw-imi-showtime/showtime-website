{{<section title="The Objective">}}
VR hardware such as the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift allows the player to manipulate virtual spaces and handle virtual objects. However when taking real objects with their (haptics)touch, feel and weight into the virtual environments to increase the degree of immersion, these techniques quickly reach their limits. In certain scenarios it is useful to have real haptic feedback of an object to interact with them in virtual worlds.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a team of four developers coming from different countries and areas of expertise, combining knowledge in audio, data visualization and virtual reality. Everybody in the team had already worked in Unity and has access to a head mounted display. All of us are interested in the future of VR and possible ussages for it, so everyone was motivated to create an intuitive interface for exploring global data in an immersive environment.
