{{<section title="Standalone VR">}}
Even though the Oculus Quest theoretically could offer hand tracking and a controller at the same time, they currently do not support this via their framework. This forced us to use the Leap Motion for hand tracking which is furthermore tying us to desktop VR. We hope they will open up this functionality in the future, because it would be more portable as a Quest app.

Right now we only use three APIâ€™s and four different visualization types, it would be very easy to add more data sources and other ways to visualize the data on the globe.
