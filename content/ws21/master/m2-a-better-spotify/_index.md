{{<section title="Our Objective">}}
Spotify is the most well-known music-streaming-platform that exists in the web-based world as we know it and even though it has billions in assets and millions of users, there are still things that could be improved and simply changed about the platform in order to give the users a better experience and simply upgrade the user journey. 

The idea under which ‘Better Spotify’ was born was trying to get **feedback from heavy users** themselves and implement them in a web application that has the same features and feel of Spotify but is an **improved** and overall **better version** (hence the name) for it.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
Due to the teams’ diverse backgrounds in the development of web-based applications, we split our group of 7 up into different teams. While there was the **research** team and the **setup** team, in the beginning, that quickly changed into certain people focusing on the **design and usability** aspect of the application while the others worked on the **implementation** of the gained information. This way, the main focus wasn’t lost along the way.
