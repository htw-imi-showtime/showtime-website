{{<section title="Research">}}
Like all projects, Better Spotify started with a lot of research. This entailed not only researching different ideas on how to add new things to the already existing version of Spotify but also researching current trends when it came to the design of music players and Websites in general.

Luckily we didn’t have to come up with an idea to what exactly the project was going to be, but we still needed to figure out in which direction we wanted to go, whether or not we wanted to focus on certain things, recreate Spotify in an entirely different way, focus on a specific **age group** and so on. 

After talking about it for a week or two, it was clear that we wanted to put our own twist on the already existing application and plainly try to improve the things we saw potential in.
In order to gain **more** information as to what exactly that would include, a focus group had to be interviewed to get an even broader array of data on the way than the internet and our own group had provided so far.

{{<section title="Focus Group #1">}}
The focus group consisted of **9 people** total, some of which were part of our own team. That way we had a foolproof way to ensure the conversation wasn’t going to come to a stop *and* to encourage the external sources to give more input. In order to get the most out of the interview, we asked the participants in advance whether or not they would consider themselves **heavy users** of music streaming platforms (using those kinds of apps at the least every other day).
That way we were able to assure knowing that they knew the application well enough to be a *trustworthy* source of information.

 - In the beginning, we prepared a **set of questions** to get a grasp as to what kind of listener the focus group participants were.
 - Then we proceeded to give them the chance to simply think about the streaming platforms and name any kind of **feature** they would want to be refurbished in any way or even added because it wasn't there yet.
 - Lastly, the focus group was presented with a **stimulus**. In our case that was 3 different kinds of music player design handpicked from the design team of the group to show different approaches to modern designs. This step was crucial to spark new ideas in the participants' minds and provide them with a different view angle to some features and even led to new wishes for features popping up. 

All of the different ideas discussed by and during the focus group were collected and written down into an **affinity board**. This was the best way to group the ideas, see whether or not doubles were made *and* have a proper way to evaluate them.

First we created different **sections**, grouping the possible tickets and ideas together before then not only putting them into our **kanban board** to provide the team with tickets to start implementing but also sorting every single one into a **requirement sheet**. 

Said requirement sheet was important for the organisation of the project because it provided the team with a proper way of **prioritising** the most important features. It also helped tremendously with creating graphs and tables that helped us stay on track of progress throughout the implementation process.

{{<section title="Design">}}

Quite early on, the team had decided to ensure a proper design was ready for every single aspect of the project. This was owed to the team knowing from experience that proper preparation speeds up the implementation process greatly. Sticking to one design means that everything is a lot **cleaner** and **more consistent** in itself and therefore needs much fewer changes later on. 

Another point that made having a proper design so very interesting and important was the possibility of **checking the design** whenever they were done. Instead of simply creating screens and passing them on to the team, each and every one of the designs was **double-checked** with a group of heavy Spotify users that agreed to do so week after week. 
This way the designs were proved over and over again, ensuring that the **usability standpoint** was as high as possible throughout the entire process. 

This meant trying out different things, different versions and improving over and over again. It meant having to **change details** and **features** more than once and even throwing away the entire basic design.

{{<section title="Implementation">}}

The implementation was quickly set up as we decided on our tech stack very early on in the project. Everybody decided on trying out **React**, some already worked with it beforehand, so the setup process began shortly after understanding the project and having a general idea of what needed to be done. 

The team's plan was to go with a proper **agile development** but it quickly became apparent that we were more or less **loosely** going for it. The team had a weekly meeting on Mondays that was fixed and occasionally met up on Thursdays with and without the product owner (our professor) to have additional talks about the process of the project. 

Usually, the team split up into smaller groups, worked on tickets together using **pair programming**, **brainstormed** together whenever we had time and made the best out of what was possible for us. Every ticket was documented in Github via the **Kanban board**.

Working **remotely** on a project and finding multiple timeslots in a week that work for all of the 7 people in the team just wasn’t realistic. 
With the help of digital meeting rooms such as Zoom, the **social distancing** in the project was no problem though and subgroups of the team were able to meet up whenever needed.

{{<section title="Focus Group #2">}}

To close off the **circle of usability** this project entailed, we decided to do a second round with our focus group and have them test the application. This time though, we didn’t do it in a big group but instead decided to go for small interviews with two people maximum. These were done with one **moderator** and another person **making notes**, ensuring that no comment goes unnoticed. 

The gist of user tests like these was letting the user take over the application and have them navigate through the different features on their own. This was entirely to ensure that the user would have the same experience as they would normally when using a new application. Having the test users **speak their minds** and **comment** on every single detail they see helped on finding out anything they were displeased with or simply confused by so that the team could react to them.

Luckily, the interviews showed that the team did a good job in incorporating the different features that were needed. Especially the homepage was fully **accepted** and **commended** by the focus group.
