{{<section title="Research">}}
As all projects, Better Spotify started with a lot of research. This entailed not only researching different ideas on how to add new things to the already existing version of Spotify but also research in current trends when it came to the design of music players and Websites in general.

Luckily we didn’t have to come up with an idea to what exactly the project was going to be, but we still needed to figure out in which direction we wanted to go, whether or not we wanted to focus on certain things, recreate Spotify in an entirely different way, focus on a specific age group and so on. 

After talking about it for a week or two, it was clear that we wanted to put our own twist on the already existing application and plainly try to improve the things we want to improve. In order to gain more information as to what exactly that would include, a focus group had to be interviewed to get an even broader array of data on the way than the internet and our own group had provided so far.

The focus group consisted of 9 people total, some of them part of our own team that we wanted to include to ensure the conversation wasn’t going to come to a stop and to encourage the external sources to give more input.

We prepared a set of questions in the beginning to get a grasp as to what kind of listener the focus group participants were, before then giving them the chance to talk about any feature they would love to be refurbished or added in general. All of these ideas were collected and evaluated.
