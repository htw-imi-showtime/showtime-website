Like all projects, Better Spotify started with a lot of research. This entailed not only researching different ideas on how to add new things to the already existing version of Spotify but also researching current trends when it came to the design of music players and Websites in general.

Luckily we didn’t have to come up with an idea to what exactly the project was going to be, but we still needed to figure out in which direction we wanted to go, whether or not we wanted to focus on certain things, recreate Spotify in an entirely different way, focus on a specific **age group** and so on. 

After talking about it for a week or two, it was clear that we wanted to put our own twist on the already existing application and plainly try to improve the things we saw potential in.
In order to gain **more** information as to what exactly that would include, a focus group had to be interviewed to get an even broader array of data on the way than the internet and our own group had provided so far.

{{<section title="Focus Group #1">}}
The focus group consisted of **9 people** total, some of which were part of our own team. That way we had a foolproof way to ensure the conversation wasn’t going to come to a stop *and* to encourage the external sources to give more input. In order to get the most out of the interview, we asked the participants in advance whether or not they would consider themselves **heavy users** of music streaming platforms (using those kinds of apps at the least every other day).
That way we were able to assure knowing that they knew the application well enough to be a *trustworthy* source of information.

 - In the beginning, we prepared a **set of questions** to get a grasp as to what kind of listener the focus group participants were.
 - Then we proceeded to give them the chance to simply think about the streaming platforms and name any kind of **feature** they would want to be refurbished in any way or even added because it wasn't there yet.
 - Lastly, the focus group was presented with a **stimulus**. In our case that was 3 different kinds of music player design handpicked from the design team of the group to show different approaches to modern designs. This step was crucial to spark new ideas in the participants' minds and provide them with a different view angle to some features and even led to new wishes for features popping up. 

All of the different ideas discussed by and during the focus group were collected and written down into an **affinity board**. This was the best way to group the ideas, see whether or not doubles were made *and* have a proper way to evaluate them.

First we created different **sections**, grouping the possible tickets and ideas together before then not only putting them into our **kanban board** to provide the team with tickets to start implementing but also sorting every single one into a **requirement sheet**. 

Said requirement sheet was important for the organisation of the project because it provided the team with a proper way of **prioritising** the most important features. It also helped tremendously with creating graphs and tables that helped us stay on track of progress throughout the implementation process.
