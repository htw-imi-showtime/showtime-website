#### [Github](https://github.com)
- During the process of the project, we used Github to share our code with one another, to keep a versioning system and to ensure that branching worked out well. We also made use of the Kanban Boards provided in the ‘Project’ tab of the repository to stay organized and maintain a good overview regarding what state our tickets were in.

{{<section title="Communication">}}

#### [Zoom](https://zoom.us)
- For any kind of meeting, we used Zoom. May it be merely the Team coming together for the weekly’s, or a talk with our product owner and professor, Zoom was the preferred tool of communication. It was especially helpful during the UX tests we had with our focus group participants in the end.

#### [Discord](https://discord.com)
- Where Zoom was used for direct face to face communication, the team chose Discord as the main tool for contacting one another in between meetings. A server was created for the project to distinguish between teams and to furthermore store information, have little polls on dates and much more.
