{{<section title="Overview">}}

As Better Spotify is an application that was created solely to provide an improved version of an already existing streaming platform, the **possible extensions** to it are truly endless. To give a short idea of what had been planned by the team but discarded due to the time restrictions, only a selected few of the **30+ ideas** in the backlog will be explained.

{{<section title="Comment function">}}


One improvement that the focus group had talked about and one of our team members had found during research was the possibility of **leaving a comment** on a song. Said comment could either be visible for everyone or just friends. It would be helpful to share songs and directly leave a review underneath them for others to see. 

Having the comments be visible for **friends only** would prevent public negativity on songs and merely be a way for friends connected over the streaming platform to communicate and share their opinions. 

It would also be a nice way to leave notes for oneself directly in the app which could be used for multiple purposes such as **reminders**, **looking back at songs**, figuring out how they affected oneself, whether or not they work with others and much more. Having a comment function, in general, could be a nice addition to the streaming platform.

{{<section title="Song catcher">}}

Most people interested in music and listening to it, find new songs while they’re out and about should know about the application Shazam which is a **Song catcher**, scanning music coming in through a mobile device’s microphone and then finding the appropriate song for it on the internet. 

Even though Shazam is already connected to Spotify when the song is available on the platform, a song catcher built into Better Spotify, which doesn’t just take the song itself but a **sung / hummed** version of it when one is trying to remember both music / lyrics themselves would be extremely handy to have. 

It would improve the way to find music in the app itself a lot even though the **AI** behind the song recognition would have to be trained very specifically for the directly sung / hummed version of songs.

{{<section title="Personal Usage Statistics">}}

Something so incredibly banal but nice to have would be a view of the personal usage of the app. Spotify already started doing it with their Spotify Rewinds at the end of every year and yet the app **fails** to *provide proper views and numbers* for the user to be constantly available. 

Tracking one’s listening history over time, the amount of **time spent on the app**, which **genre’s** are the user’s current favourite, **how many playlists** have been listened to how many times, which **songs** in them are **skipped over** a lot while others have been listened to on repeat. Statistics like those aren’t just interesting for the app itself but especially for the user to see. A positive example already presenting this form of feature would be Audible.

They could be used to **self-analyse**, **adjust listening behaviour** or even just to chat with friends and compare different **statistical points**.

{{<section title="Shortcuts">}}

Shortcuts nowadays are something that we could not imagine living without it. Having Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, the F5 button to reload and so many more are doing nothing but make our lives easier. 
Having the possibility of adding shortcuts like these to Better Spotify
 - playing the chosen song
 - making new playlists
 - stopping
 - muting
 - shuffling
 - switching tabs within the application

So far there are only extensions to browsers that make it possible for the user to have keyboard shortcuts which is definitely a missed opportunity when it comes to the **usability** of the app. Especially thinking about people not being able to click precisely with a mouse would have it much easier pressing one or two buttons to achieve the same thing. **Inclusivity** is something that definitely needs to be a part of a web applications design.
