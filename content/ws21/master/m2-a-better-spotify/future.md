As Better Spotify is an application that was created solely in order to provide an improved version as an already existing streaming platform, the possible extensions to it are **truly endless**. In order to give a short idea of what had been planned by the team but discarded due to the time restrictions, only a selected **few** of the **30+ ideas** in the backlog will be explained.

#### Comment function
One improvement that the focus group had talked about and one of our team members had found during research was the possibility of leaving a comment on a song. Said comment could either be visible for everyone or just friends. It would be helpful to share songs and directly leave a review underneath them for others to see. 

Having the comments be visible for friends only would prevent public negativity on songs and merely be a way for friends connected over the streaming platform to communicate and share their opinions. 

It would also be a nice way to leave notes for oneself directly in the app which could be used for multiple purposes such as reminders, looking back at songs, figuring out how they affected oneself, whether or not they work with others and much more. Having a comment function, in general, could be a nice addition to the streaming platform. 


#### Song catcher
Most people interested in music and listening to it, finding new songs while they’re out and about should know about the application Shazam which is a Song catcher, scanning music coming in through a mobile device’s microphone and then finding the appropriate song for it on the internet. 

Even though Shazam is already connected to Spotify when the song is available on the platform, a song catcher directly in Spotify, maybe even one that doesn’t just take the song itself but possible sung / hummed versions of it when one is trying to remember both music / lyrics themselves would be extremely handy to have. 

It would improve the way to find music in the app itself a lot even though the AI behind the song recognition would have to be trained very specifically for the directly sung / hummed version of songs. 

#### Personal Usage Statistics
Something so incredibly banal but nice to have would be a view of the personal usage of the app. Spotify already started doing it with their Spotify Rewinds at the end of every year and yet the app fails to provide proper views and numbers for the user to be constantly available. 

Tracking one’s listening history over time, the amount of time spent on the app, which genre’s are the user’s current favourite, how many playlists have been listened to how many times, which songs in them are skipped over a lot while others have been listened to on repeat. Statistics like those aren’t just interesting for the app itself but especially for the user to see. 

They could be used to self-analyse, adjust listening behaviour or even just to chat with friends and compare different statistical points. 

#### Shortcuts
Shortcuts nowadays are something that we couldn’t live without. Having Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, the F5 button to reload and so many more are doing nothing but make our lives easier. Having the possibility of adding shortcuts like these to Better Spotify, connecting them to playing the chosen song, making new playlists, stopping, muting, shuffling, switching tabs within the application and anything else one can think of. 

So far there are only extensions to browsers that make it possible for the user to have keyboard shortcuts which is definitely a missed opportunity when it comes to the usability of the app. Especially thinking about people not being able to click precisely with a mouse would have it much easier pressing one or two buttons to achieve the same thing. 

#### Notification

Spotify already provides its users with a notification symbol in the top right of mobile, desktop and web app. Unfortunately though, the feature is entirely unused by the majority of Spotify users simply because nothing ever gets displayed in there. It would be the perfect place to show news from followed artists, bands, podcasts and much more, yet the notification bell is constantly empty.

Using this feature in its entirety would provide the user with more, quicker and better knowledge on upcoming features, songs and episodes. Having all of this information nicely organized in one feature would also help the application from being cluttered, improving the user experience even more.
