To make patients of Long Covid feel even less alone, our app should also provide 
* a possibility for them to connect with others in the same situation to exchange experiences
* a way to document experiences in their own words, like a in a blog, that they can share with others who are not affected

To help people be even better informed our app could integrate a newsletter on new research about Long Covid.

Finally we also need to add information on our privacy policy.
