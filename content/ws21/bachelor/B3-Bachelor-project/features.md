## Profile - Status
Since allmende is a social network app, a good looking profile page is a must have.
Thatâ€™s why we created a minimalistic profile page for the user to share information
about themself, check which challenges they have accomplished and look at their
personal posts. Part of every allmende profile is also one of many status icons,
which have to be unlocked through challenges, to see if a user is a Tree-Hugger, a
Mushroom-Head or something different.

## Sightings and Challenges
A user can create entries to share their nature experience with others. A user can add a photo of insects, birds, plants, amphibians or any other organism they found to entry, add location and even record how it sounds. Each entry is displayed in the feed and can be liked and commented by others.

To motivate others to explore the environment a user can create challenges. A challenge could be for example to find 5 different types of birds.

## Badges
In the context of gamification, we wanted to implement a new rewarding feature, for finishing challenges. 

## Map
antonia

## Allmendex
The allmendex is a giant collection of the local flora and fauna build into the app.
The idea behind allmendex was to have a clearly arranged dictionary of plants and
animals with short, useful information and pictures while also creating a motivation
for users to go outside and engage with their outdoor world. Since the allmendex is
empty at the beginning, ambitious users quickly want to fill their allmendex and find
them all.
