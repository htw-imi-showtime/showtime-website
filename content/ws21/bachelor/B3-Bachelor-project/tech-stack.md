#### Discord 

Discord was the platform the used the most to communicate about the
development of allmende. It was the place where we were in constant exchange not
only with the team but also with our supervisor David Müller. We took advantage of
many useful tools that discord can offer like the creation of threads to discuss
features or the up or down-voting of messages to decide whether a feature should
be integrated or not. These tools in combination with multiple text and voice
channels that even allow live screen sharing made discord a good project
management platform for us.

#### Zoom

in Addition to discord we also used the video conference platform Zoom for our
weekly meeting every Monday and also sometimes during the week for group
session. Usually this would have been possible on discord as well but some team
members preferred Zoom.

#### Notion

#### Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ

The majority of team members used Visual Studio Code as their text editor
because it offers the best compatibility when working with libraries like React and
because it is in general a very powerful editor for web development. The rest
preferred working with JetBrain’s IntelliJ.

#### React

For the **tracking capabilities** of our App, we are using the **Google Maps API** for Flutter. It is provided via the **Google Cloud Services** and free to use within a certain request limit. But for our use case, that was **plenty enough**!

#### GitHub

#### Docker

#### Postman and Swagger

Another tool we used was the API Platform Postman. We used Postman a lot for
testing features that rely on data from the backend because it really helped
understanding how the data flows at every step of the app lifecycle.
