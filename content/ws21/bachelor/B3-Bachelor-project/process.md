The original idea for the allmende app came from David MuÌˆller, who was the
supervisor for our project. He created the app for his master thesis with the goal to
inspire people for nature through social-network-structures and gamification.

After agreeing on recreating the App with **React**, we briefly familiarized ourselves with it, \


Going into the development period, we separated the group into **three teams**, concerned with the general **UI**, **map visualization** and **database design**. 
This way, we could focus on different tasks while maintaining communication within the group and making use of agile techniques like **pair programming** and **code review**. 
Maintaining our source code with Git allowed us to simultaneously implement different features on their respective branches and avoid conflicts when integrating them. \
We manifested a **biweekly rhythm for the big team meetings** with our supervisor in which we reviewed our recent progress, **collected feedback** and **set goals** for the **following two-week period**. 
Additional weekly calls with the core team helped us to stay current on each other's progress and resolve potential issues.\
Throughout the development phase, we **continuously updated our Backlog** of ideas, **collectively taking** on the **role** of a **product owner**. Making use of project management tools, we constructed user stories and arranged them in a Story Map, 
thereby identifying and refining **the most important features**.

We look back on a project that for many of us posed the **first opportunity** to **experience the development** of a **software product** from start to finish. 
Besides our advancement in **cross-platform application** **development**, creating Strollr taught us a great deal about **planning and managing** larger software projects. \
While communication can be a bit challenging in a team of 8, we never experienced any major misconceptions or disagreements. Naturally, we faced a **few technical** **hurdles** when writing our code, such as **conflicting Flutter plugins** 
or problems with the **cross-platform compatibility** of certain features. However, **determination** and **mutual help** within the team **resolved all the issues** at hand.
