{{<section title="Idea">}}

The original idea for the allmende app came from David MuÌˆller, who was the
supervisor for our project. He created the app for his master thesis with the goal to
inspire people for nature through social-network-structures and gamification.

After agreeing on recreating the App with **React**, we briefly familiarized ourselves with it, \


Going into the development period, we separated the group into **three teams**, concerned with the general **UI**, **map visualization** and **database design**. 
This way, we could focus on different tasks while maintaining communication within the group and making use of agile techniques like **pair programming** and **code review**. 
Maintaining our source code with Git allowed us to simultaneously implement different features on their respective branches and avoid conflicts when integrating them. \
We manifested a **biweekly rhythm for the big team meetings** with our supervisor in which we reviewed our recent progress, **collected feedback** and **set goals** for the **following two-week period**. 
Additional weekly calls with the core team helped us to stay current on each other's progress and resolve potential issues.\
Throughout the development phase, we **continuously updated our Backlog** of ideas, **collectively taking** on the **role** of a **product owner**. Making use of project management tools, we constructed user stories and arranged them in a Story Map, 
thereby identifying and refining **the most important features**.

{{<section title="Reflection">}}

The project was for many of us a first experience of building an application from start to finish. So one of our main challenges was the lack of experience in project management and planning. Looking back on the work we did, we think that what helped us the most was good and effective communication between project members and with our mentor. Moreover, we managed to have weekly meetings, which helped us to keep eye on the project and to plan the further development of features.
