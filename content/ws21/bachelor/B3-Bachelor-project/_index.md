{{<section title="The Team">}}

We are a team of students with varying levels of work and study experience. Nevertheless we devided the tasks equaly, dispite our experience, so everybody was able to learn a whole lot. Unfurtunately, with the ongoing pandemic, unexceptional we meet online. All together we had a very friendly and also professional working atmosphere and helped each other a lot. We had a great time creating and improving Allmende and hope you will do too, using it.
