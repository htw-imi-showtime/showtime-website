{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
**Time** is **money** and Penny Pincher saves you **both**!
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="The Team">}}
The Penny Pincher team is comprised of **motivated students** with different levels of programming experience and interests. None of us had previously worked with **Dart** or **Flutter**, so over the course of this semester we were able to learn **a lot**! Fortunately we were able to meet a few times at **idealo** and work **together**, but due to Covid regulations we had to continue **working remotely**. Still, we managed to keep up with deadlines and create an **awesome app**.
