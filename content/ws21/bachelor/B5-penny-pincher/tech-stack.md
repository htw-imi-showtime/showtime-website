#### Discord
Discord was our **main** way of communicating with each other, asking questions and it served as our **remote working space**. We used voice channels to split into teams and work on different tasks and text channels to inform each other of new pull requests and general info around the project.

#### Miro
We used Miro as a means of **sharing** our **ideas**, **prototypes**, discussing **new tasks** and **updating** our progress on the app, basically a place for us to **brainstorm** during our meetings.

#### Flutter™️
From the beginning it was suggested by our supervisor that we work with **Flutter**, as it is **beginner-friendly** and can deploy on both **Android** and **iOS** with very little work. Unfortunately only one of us owned a Macbook and at some point Flutter stopped working there. Publishing the app on the AppStore would have also costed us money ($99/year), so we **mainly** worked on the **android** side. 

#### Android Studio, IntelliJ or Visual Code?
Everyone chose an IDE that they were **comfortable** with, as they all offer **integration** for the **Flutter SDK**.

#### GitHub
GitHub is where we stored **all tasks**, **issues** and **organized** them in different sections: **Backlog**, **To Do**, and **Done**. Most of us dug deep for the first time in Git and we had **difficulties** concerning commiting, merging, branches, etc. however due to our **dilligence** we were able to pull through and **learned** how to **organize** a git project.
