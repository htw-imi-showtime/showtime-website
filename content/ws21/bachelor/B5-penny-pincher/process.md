{{<section title="Idea">}}
The **initial idea** was to create an app that allows users to find bargains **easily** and **efficiently**. No matter if you're looking for a last minute Christmas present or just want to browse around.
With the help of our supervisors Tino Nitze and Jakob Panten we were able to come up with the **top feature** of our app: the **Live Feed** - where you get new bargains **live**! Once we had our first meeting in the Idealo headquarters, we were able to create our git project and had an **unofficial Design Sprint**.

Once we agreed on a **design concept**, we decided to split into different **groups** to work on the different pages: live feed, browser, favorites and extended view. Since none of us had **previous experience** with Flutter, we had to briefly familiarize ourselves with the framework.
By the 8. of November we already had a **simple mockup** of these four pages.

Working separately like this required a lot of **communication**, so we had meetings on **Monday** and **Thursday** every week which were mainly on **discord** due to Covid. During the meetings we discussed what **has been done** since the last meeting and what **needs to be done** for the day. Everyone was on different voice channels for **co-working** which enabled us to ask each other freely for **help and advice**.
Thanks to the **Design Sprint**, we were able to fill our backlog with a lot of **tasks** and **issues**. Throughout the development phase we kept adding **new issues**, made up **new user stories** and **continuously improved our app**.
Through our **hard work** we already had a **complete protoype** of the app by the end of November, so we decided to make a **second official Design Sprint** to discuss **app optimizations** and **new features**.

Throughout December we implemented the **ideas** from our Design Sprint. We decided to add a **Welcome Screen**, where the user can choose the categories heâ€™s **interested** in. We were also able to **refactor** our code.
And in January we worked on **further optimizations** and implemented the **new** and **improved** **Live Feed** version. Our app looked like this on the 10. of January:

{{<section title="Reflection">}}
Even though we had **no experience** with Flutter or working on such a big project beforehand, our team stayed **motivated** until the end! Not only did we create something **great**, but we also made **longlasting friendships** and learned **a lot** about **managing** a project and **building** an app.
We experienced a couple of **complications**: in a team of nine people, it's easy to lose the overall view of who has done what, and what problems need to be solved. Sometimes there were merges into main, that weren't discussed beforehand. That led to unnecessary bugs and stress. Nevertheless our team stayed **focused** and we always **voted fairly** and **acknowledged each other's opinons**, which helped us create a very **nice atmosphere**. We were all very **excited** to work on such a big project for a company such as Idealo.
