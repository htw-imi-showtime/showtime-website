The Live Feed is the <b>main feature</b> of this app. Here you can choose one or more of the eleven main categories you're interested in and see "live" <b>the newest bargains</b> for these products.

If you do <b>not</b> choose <b>any</b> categories, then you see <b>all products</b> from all categories.
