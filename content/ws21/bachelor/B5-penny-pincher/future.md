{{<section title="So, what's next?">}}
For now we would like to **keep working** on this project **privately** and keep **improving** it! We have come far but there is still a lot that we would like to do..

{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Additional Features">}}
#### Social Media Hub
There are some **new** features we would like to add in the future such as adding **notifications** for **limited time offers** and being able to choose between main and sub categories in browser. We would also like to implement a feature that lets you **choose** the **discount range** in Live Feed.

For now our app is available only in German, and we would like to offer it in **English** as well.

Another cool feature would be to create **custom categories** such as "The perfect Christmas present", "The perfect Valentine's present" etc. because we believe that a big part of our users might be looking for presents. This will make their search easier and save them time!

_So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and find the perfect bargain!_
