Allmende has a huge potentional for the further grow. As the following step we see a development and writing a Rules of Conduct in order to moderate user-generated content. Moreover, Allmende is now accessible in a Webbrowser, the next step would be to make it available for mobile through the channels like Apple Store.

Like every development team working with a deadline we had to cut out some
features that were planned at the beginning but had to be postponed. For the future
we are motivated to add a chat function for users to exchange information in oneon-
one chats as well as having larger topic based group chats. Another feature that
we really want to add to the app in the future is to allow users to plan walks in the
local area and share them through the app. It can be a topic based route to find a
specific animal or just a beautiful walk in the nature. These walks can then be
seated and discussed by everyone in the community. Lastly we thought that the app
would really benefit from a thread-feature like reddit for users to ask questions and
general larger discussion.
