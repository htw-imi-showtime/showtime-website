## Profile
Since allmende is a social network app, a good looking profile page is a must have.
That’s why we created a minimalistic profile page for the user to share information
about themself, check which **challenges** they have accomplished and look at their
**personal posts**. Part of every allmende profile is also one of many **status** icons,
which have to be unlocked through challenges, to see if a user is a Tree-Hugger, a
Mushroom-Head or something different.

## Sightings and Challenges
A user can **create entries** to share their nature experience with others. A user can add a photo of insects, birds, plants, amphibians or any other organism they found to entry, add **location** and even **record how it sounds**. Each entry is displayed in the feed and can be **liked and commented** by others.

To motivate others to explore the environment a user can **create challenges**. A challenge could be for example to find 5 different types of birds. You can view your sightings and challenges in your **feed**.

## Badges - Status
In the context of gamification, we wanted to implement a new **rewarding feature**, for finishing challenges. So we createt **badges**. There are three types of badge in every animal or plant category, there are bronze, silver and gold badges. When you earned the third (gold)Badge of a category you will get a new **status** in your profile view.

## Map
You are curious about the **location of the communities’ sightings**? You can find out the habitat of different species in **your area** by looking at the **Allmende Map**! Clicking on a sighting location will show you the sighting. It is also possible to **filter** the map by categories and found species!

## Allmendex
The **allmendex** is a giant collection of the local flora and fauna build into the app.
The idea behind allmendex was to have a clearly arranged **dictionary of plants and**
**animals** with short, useful information and pictures while also creating a motivation
for users to go outside and engage with their outdoor world. Since the allmendex is
empty at the beginning, ambitious users quickly want to fill their allmendex and **find**
**them all**.
