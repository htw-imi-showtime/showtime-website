{{<section title="So, what's next?">}}

Creating a whole game in such a **short time span** was no easy task. Basing that game on psychological research even less so.
We are very excited to publish a fleshed out game, even if we had to **cut some of the planned features short**.

There are **many ideas** we could still expand on. But whether some of us might return to this game, or if we'll all start new
projects utilising the experience we gathered during this one, remains to be seen.

## Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
Currently the game is **only available in german**. To make it further accessible though, we thought about implementing at least an
**English option**. However, this would have forced us to separate the evaluation into another test group, since the exact wording
of a question can influence the answer greatly. It also would have taken us quite some extra time to translate the complete
script and implement it. \
Thus we decided to not include a language option into this release, it's still possible to add this feature later on.


## Quests, Quests, Quests
Currently, there are **3 different quest types** in the game: Collect Quests, Talk Quests, and Quest Quests (that's when your quest
goal is to complete a list of other quests).

But during the designing process, we had many more ideas. For example, we considered **Time Quests**, in which you maybe had to
collect something or go somewhere, before a Timer was up. \
We also briefly considered **Combat Quests**, but such a mechanic would require an entire combat system behind it. We realised quite
early on, that we would not have enough time to spare for that, so we decided not to include it and instead focus on our other
features. But in the future we might have the time for more elaborately designed quests like these.

## A look in the Mirror
Another feature we originally had planned was a **character creator**.
We had actually already **started designing** this feature, and even implemented a first Prototype.
In the end however, we unfortunately had to **discard it for the final version**, due to a lack of time. Planned were different
body types, hairstyles, accessories and color customization.

## Where to next?
Besides the big Map, we also had a MiniMap planned. That way, it would have been easier to see where a new Quest is, **without
having to open a separate menu** all the time. Unfortunately, this feature had been **cut from the final version**.

## It's a big, big world
Currently our Game world is rather small, so we can load all of it simultaneously without creating incredibly **long loading times**.
But with bigger worlds this isn't really an option. \
Instead we'd have to **only load the parts of the world**, in which the player is currently in. That can be easily done by implementing
a world grid, which only loads the local and all adjacent parts. \
In the very beginning, we weren't entirely sure yet how big our game was going to be. That's why we already started creating a
**world grid prototype**. So if we ever decide to expand our current island, this feature could easily be reimplemented.

## All fun and games
We had the idea of including a few **minigames** all throughout our game. These could offer a bit more **variety** and make little
tasks like fishing, refilling the firewood or solving the scientist's riddles much more **fun** for the player.


## Thank you for playing!
After sending our finished game to a bunch of **test players**, not only did we receive valuable data on how well our game can
imitate a regular personality quiz, we also got a lot of **feedback on the game** itself.
Be it possible changes to the UI Design, easily misunderstood Dialogs or more intuitive control changes, there are many small
details which could still be **improved**.
