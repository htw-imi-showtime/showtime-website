{{<section title="The Game" >}}
After a shipwreck you find yourself **stranded on a small tropical island**. Luckily, someone noticed you floating there in your 
bright life vest. They would like to bring you to the main island, as there is a ship which might **bring you home**. But without 
any money, paying for the fare won't be possible. Luckily though, the Captain offered you a free ride in return for some **help 
around the island**. So go and see what the island inhabitants have in store for you!


OCEAN features the classic, **well-known RPG controls** that should immediately be familiar to a lot of players.
But no need to worry if you don't have much gaming experience yet. We tried to design the game to be as **accessible 
to everyone** regardless of their age and their gaming experience, so of course there will be a handy 
tutorial available.

{{<section title="Personality Evaluation" >}}

Our game is designed after the **IPIP-Test**, which is a personality survey based on the **Big Five Personality Markers** by 
Lewis R. Goldberg. This theory posits that the human personality can be measured as a combination of 5 key factors:
- ***O*penness**: acceptance to new ideas
- ***C*onscientiousness**: self control, act dutifully
- ***E*xtroversion**: comfortableness around people
- ***A*greeableness**: general concern for social harmony
- ***N*euroticism**: tendency to experience negative emotions

The questionnaire contains a variety of questions, each relating to one of these traits. Depending on the person's answer, 
the score for that factor goes up or down. \
At the end, the scores represent how strong or weakly each characteristic is in that person. The combination of these levels 
can then determine the general composition of the individual's personality.


## In-Game Evaluation
To determine the players personality through a game, we are **evaluating the player's choices and playing-style**. For that, we 
designed quests and dialog options **based on the survey questions**. \
For example, to convert the question “I have a soft heart”, we created a scenario in which the player encounters a homeless person.
Now, they can choose if they'd rather help or ignore him. \
Depending on the decision, we are adding to or subtracting from the score for that according trait. That way, we can use the **same
calculation the survey uses** to evaluate the results.

## Questionnaire
To check how well our game can imitate the classical test format, we also gave the players a regular **personality questionnaire**,
using the questions from the german version of the **IPIP-Test** from Fritz Ostendorf.
To prevent any influence from the questionnaire to our game (or the other way around) we decided to implement a 50/50 chance of 
getting the test either **before or after the game**.

At the very end, the questionnaire and the game **result are compared to each other**, and the player gets both results presented.
