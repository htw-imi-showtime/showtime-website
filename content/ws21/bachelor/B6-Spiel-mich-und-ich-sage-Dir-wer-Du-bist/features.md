{{<section title="The Game" >}}
After a shipwreck you find yourself stranded on a **small tropical island**. Luckily, the island isn't entirely deserted as you
find a local inhabitant willing to help you. They would like to bring you to the main island, as there is a ship which might
**bring you home**. But without any money, paying for the fare won't be possible. Luckily though, the Captain offered you a free
ride in return for some **help around the island**. So go and see what the island inhabitants have in store for you!

OCEAN includes many of the **classic features found in most RPGs**. You can talk to a variety of NPCs, make your own dialog choices,
complete different quests, collect items, walk around exploring the island or quickly find your way by taking a look at the
map. It also features the **well-known RPG controls** that should immediately be familiar to a lot of players. \
If none of these things sound familiar to you though, no need to worry! We designed the game to be as **accessible** to
everyone regardless of their age and their gaming experience as possible, so of course there will be a handy **tutorial** available.

{{<section title="Personality Evaluation" >}}

Our game is designed after Goldberg's (1992) **Big-Five Factor Markers** based on the **IPIP question catalogue**. This theory
posits that the human personality can be measured and described as a combination of 5 key factors:

- ***O**penness*: acceptance to new ideas
- ***C**onscientiousness*: self control, act dutifully
- ***E**xtroversion*: comfortableness around people
- ***A**greeableness*: general concern for social harmony
- ***N**euroticism*: tendency to experience negative emotions

The questionnaire contains a variety of questions, each relating to one of these traits. Depending on the person's answer,
the score for that factor goes up or down. \
At the end, the scores represent **how strongly pronounced each characteristic is** in that specific person. However, a low or
high score does not equal a worse or better person. The combination of these levels simply determine the **general composition
of the individual's personality**.



## In-Game Evaluation
To determine the players personality through a game, we are **evaluating the player's choices and playing-style**. For that, we
designed quests and dialog options **based on the survey questions**. \
For example, to convert the question “I have a soft heart”, we created a scenario in which the player encounters a homeless person.
Now, they can choose if they'd rather help or ignore him. \
Depending on the decision, we are adding to or subtracting from the score for that according trait. That way, we can use the **same
calculation the survey uses** to evaluate the results.

## Questionnaire
To check how well our game can imitate the classical test format, we also gave the players a regular **personality questionnaire**,
using the questions from the german version of the **IPIP-Test** from Fritz Ostendorf. \
To prevent our data being falsified by any influence the questionnaire might have on playing our game (or the game on answering
the questionnaire) we decided to implement a 50/50 chance of getting the test either **before or after the game**. This actually
proved to be a good decision later on, as the evaluation showed vastly different results for both groups.

At the very end, the questionnaire and the game **result are compared to each other**, and the player gets both results presented.
