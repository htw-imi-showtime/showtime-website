{{<section title="Communication, Organisation">}}

## Discord
Our main communication tool was Discord, since it not only offers different **text channels for each department**, it also
contains voice channels in which we could hold our **weekly meeting**. Like that we could easily share information, ask quick
questions or clarify issues, all while **keeping a clear overview**.

## Trello
We used Trello to get an **overview** for the tasks, which needed to be dealt with. Trello was a good choice because we could label
the tasks with **how important** they are, in **which department** they fall into. Additionally, everybody was able to see **who was
working on what** right now, what tasks were **already done**, and what was still on our **To-Do-List**.

## Drive
With Google Drive we were able to **gather all of our data**, research results, and design documents in one cloud repository.
It also allowed us to **collectively work on the same documents** online, which made it easy to check, correct, and expand on others'
work. \
It was also already familiar to everyone in the team and very easy to use, which made it perfect for our project.

## Miro
Miro was our **vision board**, a place where we could design our **first drafts** for OCEAN. It was a space for **brainstorming,
creative thinking** and **sharing ideas**, which the many tools miro offers supported.

## Unity
We chose Unity as our **game engine**, since most of the team members were already familiar with working with it. Unity also
supports development for **browser based games**, which was perfect for our purposes.

## Github
Github allowed us to collaborate on our project very easily. Although some of us weren't too familiar with it
yet, we had basically **no merging errors** thanks to **good branching and communication**.

## Itch.io
Itch.io is a platform which enables indie game developers to **freely host and sell their games**. \
That made it possible for us to **share our game online** and run it directly in the browser, without our test players
having to download or install anything.

## PlayFab
PlayFab is a **backend platform**, offering a variety of backend services, like analysing gaming data. \
That meant we could easily **access the players' personality results** to evaluate and compare them.

## PSPP
GNU PSPP is a free program for **statistical analysis** of sampled data. It is the free, yet still powerful version of the
most commonly used statistics tool, SPSS. We used it to display and organise the participant's values.
