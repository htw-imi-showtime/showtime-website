{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
With Strollr we want to use a **playful approach** to **encourage young students** to **explore nature and discover something new with every walk**.
{{</section>}}

{{<section title="The Team">}}
Behind Strollr, there is a **motivated team** of students with **varying levels** of work **and study experience**. With the ongoing pandemic and some of our **teammates** being **located outside of Berlin**, we **never got to meet in person**, but still managed to make the best out of the situation by **working remotely** with a number of **communication tools**. 
Each of us contributing our **previous experience** and giving it **our best**, we had a great time together and hope you enjoy Strollr **as much as we do**!
