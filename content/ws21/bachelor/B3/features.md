## Map and Tracking
One of the **key features** of our App is the possibility to **pin-point your location** and track every move while you're on a stroll out in the wild. With that information, we are **creating a Map** with 
the **path** and **pictures** youâ€™ve taken along your adventures outside.

## Camera and Photo Editor
Next up is our **Photo Editor**. During your time strolling around, you might want to **take pictures** of all kinds of **plants, trees or animals** you encounter. With Strollr, you have the option to **turn those pictures into masterpieces**!
With the help of our powerful photo editor you are able to make every picture you've taken shine. You can adjust **contrast, brightness, crop or use filters**! 

## Questionnaire
Strollr is **aimed** especially at **kids at school age**, to deliver an **additional form** of interaction for them **to engage with the environment**. 
That is why we have implemented the **questionnaire feature**! Here children are able to **note what they know** **about** a certain **plant or animal**, 
thus there is the option to **take notes** and **write down questions that** they can **discuss with teachers or parents** later on.

## Herbarium
The **Gallery** is the next big feature of Strollr. Here you are able to **revisit** your **pictures** and remember the **tracks** you were on! Below the photo, you can see crucial information to your subject! 
So every **information you provide**, is **saved** and there for you to **edit afterwards**!

## Statistics
We also provide information on your current **statistics** like **walked kilometers** and **time spent** for strolling around.
