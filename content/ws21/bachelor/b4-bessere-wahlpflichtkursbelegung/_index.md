{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Since all of us have to use it to apply for our elective courses, we found some **inconvenieces with the LSF** we all could relate to.

Instead of clicking back and forth, struggling to find the right courses for yourself and losing your mind when they dont fit your time schedule at the end, we wanted to create a **simple interface with all the important information** at a glance.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
As a team, we wanted to clarify that all of us **picture the same outcome** of this project and wanted to give everyone the **chance to suggest ideas** from the first day on. With our **diverse experience and specialties**, we were able to inspire each other with new thoughts all the time.
Not only could we gain **much experience with web development**, but also with how it is to **deal with a ...** and working on the same project with multiple people in a team.
