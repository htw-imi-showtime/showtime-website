{{<section title="Continued in a bachelor thesis">}}

Just like we continued the work of Julia, our project is going to be continued to maybe add some of the features we came up with and improve the application even more.

{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Extensions">}}

Our task was to make the elective course registration for IMI bachelor students easier. However, our final product can easily be extended.

#### All HTW students
Since the studyplan can only help IMI bachelor students with their elective course registration and organization so far, the next step would be to make it **usable for master students and someday all the other students** as well.

#### All courses
Instead of only being able to register for elective courses, the application can be extended so that you are able to **apply for all the other courses as well**. We were focusing on the elective courses for now, since we could see that the most trouble is happening there. We also worked out a fitting user interface while the UI team was playing around with different ideas, which could show all available courses without getting too confusing.

{{<section title="Forking information from reliable source">}}

Currently, the students have to manually indicate information about them, so we have to rely on them being honest with their data. By getting the correct data like starting semester, increased priority or what they are studying, we **could make sure that the data is always correct and the user would not have to do less work** before starting to use our application. Besides that, the **course information could also be obtained from an official database**.

{{<section title="Supporting mobile devices">}}

Because there are probably some students who would like to register for their courses on the way, supporting mobile devices would also be a good idea to **increase compatibility**.

{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Further usage">}}

Ideally, the application could be used as the **official elective course registration** for the IMI bachelor students or even more than that as mentioned before. This would mandatorily need some additional checks for security, so that we can rely on a safe course registration.
