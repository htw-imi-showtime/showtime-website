{{<section title="Continued in a bachelor thesis">}}

Just like we continued the work of Julia, *someone* is going to continue this project to maybe add some of the features we came up with to improve the application even more.

{{<section title="Extension to all HTW students">}}

Since the studyplan can only help IMI bachelor students with their course registration and organization so far, the next challenge would be to make it **usable for master students and someday all the other students** as well.

{{<section title="Forking student information from reliable source">}}

Currently, the students have to manually indicate information about them, so we have to rely on them being honest with their data. By getting the correct data like starting semester, increased priority or what they are studying, we **could make sure that the data is always correct and the user would not have to do less work** before starting to use our application.
