{{<section title="Developing Tools">}}

For the developing process, we used the **"MEVN" stack**, which consists of widely used and good documented tools to build a web application with **HTML, CSS and Javascript**. The tool that we worked the most with from this stack was Vue.js, since it is easy to learn and had the advantage of being reactive.
