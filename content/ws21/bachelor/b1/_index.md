{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
We want **Vibro's UI** to be modified and enhanced so that **novices** can understand and use the program more easily and with fewer problems. Vibro should be improved so that we rank higher than 2021 in the 2022 **Video Browser Showdown**.

{{<section title="The Team">}}
We are a group of 7 students with **different skills**, **levels of knowledge** and **work experience** coming together with high motivation to create a good user experience. Our group was lucky enough to start our project with the possibility of coming together in real life. 

We had the valuable experience of getting to know each other face to face and with the help of games we built a great team spirit what would go beyond the project. Discussing our goals and ideas together in one room was essential to unite them in our vision for this project. 

As we had to change to online work due to Covid, regular meetings over the week helped us to maintain structure and keep up good communication. When challenges arose, we helped out each other and mastered them together.
