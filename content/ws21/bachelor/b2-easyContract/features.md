{{<section title="Contract generator">}}
Our main feature is the **contract generator**, which sets the **framework** for the contract creation process. 
This enables StartRight to access a database of contract modules more **quickly** and to create the **suitable** contract for each customer.\
At first the **legal form** for a new contract should be selected. 
After that the user can see **text blocks**, matching the selected legal form. 
These text blocks can then be **inserted** into a ready-made **text field** using **drag & drop** function. \
There is also a possibility to **search** through the blocks, **add** new ones, **edit** or **delete** them. 
Finally the contract can be **downloaded** as **txt.** or **docx.** file format.

{{<section title="Project overview">}}
In order to have a **better overview** of internal and external **projects** in each **StartRight** workspace, 
the application offers a feature in which **ongoing projects** can be displayed and members can **collaborate**.
These can be called up by the **associated participants** and lead the user to a new page on which all **important information** is listed and **useful notes** can be created.
