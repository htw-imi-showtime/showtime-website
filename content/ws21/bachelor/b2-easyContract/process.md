{{<section title="Idea">}}
**StartRight** wanted an application that would allow them to **create contracts faster**. \
After our first **conversation** and the resulting **wishes**, we worked out a **concept** together on how we could **simplify the work processes** of the student organization. \
We decided to develop **not only** the **contract generator**, but a **whole application** with **additional features**.

{{<section title="Concept">}}
Before planning the concept, we **researched** existing tools that were similar to our idea.
In several meetings with the students from **StartRight**, we also considered **further features** and **ideas** that make sense as an **extension** to the application.
All **ideas** and **considerations** then became our **goals**.

{{<section title="Prototype">}}
After the **entire concept** was in place, we could **start implementing** it and created our **first prototype**. 
We also got acquainted with our **tech stack** which we discussed and chose really thoroughly.

{{<section title="Development">}}
We divided the **individual functions** of our application within the **team** in order to **separate responsibilities** so that one or two people could concentrate on their task. \
In case of any **problems** or **challenges**, we sat down together to **exchange** our **ideas** and **solutions**. \
Due to the **weekly sprints**, there were always **prioritizations** of the individual features.
