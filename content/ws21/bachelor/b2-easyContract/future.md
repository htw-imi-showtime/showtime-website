* Completing **role assignment** through which access rights for the website are controlled.
* The **linking** of the **calendar** and the **project overview** is a useful extension for assigning notes to an appointment directly to a project.
* The optimization of the **contract generator** with regard to the dependencies of the text modules on each other is another big step to help **StartRight**.
