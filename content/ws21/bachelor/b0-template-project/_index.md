This is a **simple paragraph**. It might contain some **more details regarding your project**.
It could be lead on with a subheadline but it doesn't have to have one.
This one doesn't have one for example.
By the way: It is always good to **highlight important words** or segments.
It makes walls of text **more interesting** as well as **faster to process**. 
Feel free to insert some [links](https://example.com/) if necessary.
Always keep it concise and simple. You know, it is the internet, nobody really *likes* to read.

Here is another paragraph.
This one **actually does have a subheadline.**
But apart from that it isn't really that much different from the first one.
All the other things still apply. **Highlight important stuff**, keep it simply, etc, etc.
Here are some words for you that are nice: photography, sunset, holidays, fox, paper plane, chocolate, sleep, pollywog, morning dew. Oh yeah, **let's spice things up with a quote:**

{{<section title="The Team">}}
How did you **split the work load**? Who was responsible for the front end? What obstacles did you overcome?
Some teams of previous terms shared pictures of themselves, some did not.
It's up to you. Also keep in mind that **you don't have to follow the structure of this template**.
It is just a suggestion. If you upload **pictures of the team members** make sure they **are square!**
