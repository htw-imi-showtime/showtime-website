## Adding your project presentation


1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the project:
(cloning the archive submodule is optional)

2.a Without archive submodule:

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:<your-account>/showtime-website.git
cd showtime-website
```
you can always get the archive later by running:
```
git submodule update --init project-archive
```

2.b Complete with archive submodule:
(The former semester - you don't need it and its large.)

```
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your-account>/showtime-website.git
cd showtime-website
```

3. [Install Hugo (extended)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)  
&nbsp;  
You can check your installation by executing hugo server and visiting http://localhost:1313/ in your browser. If you get an error:
    - Did you install the Hugo extended version? This is needed for Hugo to correctly compile the theme's SCSS files


4. Create a branch. Never change main directly, but keep main synced with the main repository and merge main into your branch regularly. 

```
git checkout -b b#_your_project_as_a_branch_name
```

5. Create your project directory like in the 2 examples below.   
Make sure to replace the semester, the b/m, the project name appropriately and make sure to include your project number (e.g. b2, m1, ...)!  
All file names should only contain lowercase letters, numbers, `-`, `_` and one `.` to separate the extension.

```
# example for bachelor - the last parameter is the directory name that will be created:
hugo new --kind project ss25/bachelor/b3-myproject
# example for master:
hugo new --kind project ss25/master/m3-the-short-project-name
```

6. Fill out your project's homepage `content/ss25/<bachelor/master>/##-your-project/_index.md` and any subpages in your project's directory you'd like to keep. Delete the subpages you don't need.  
&nbsp;  
Have a look at the [section documentation](doc/project/content_guide.md) or the template projects for including headings, images and videos.  
If you need help with the markdown syntax, have a look at this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).  
You may also put images in your project's directory (**less than 100 MB per file**, please upload videos to the HTW Mediathek and embed them).

7. Preview your changes locally to make sure everything looks fine by executing `hugo server --buildDrafts` and visiting http://localhost:1313/ in your browser. (of use `make`)

8. Add your changes to the git index, commit them to the repository and push them to GitHub.

```
git add content/ss25/<bachelor|master>/<project_number-your-project>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

9. To publish your branch directly, Activate Github Actions, Switch on Github Pages for your repo (settings->Pages, choose GitHub Actions as source), and run the "Deploy Page using GH-Actions" workflow manually.

10. Create a new pull request on GitHub that merges your version of your branch onto the htw-imi-showtime `main` branch. For more info see [pull_request.md](doc/git/pull_request.md)  
More information can be found in the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md)

11. As you are not (or, unless you are) member of the organization/repo htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website, you cannot use the github feature to request a review. Feel free to use the comments for that, and open the pull request as early as possible. We need to enable the Workflow runs once manually, after that they will be re-run automatically on each push to your branch the PR is based upon. 



## We are using the Forking Workflow.

Note: we are essentially using the "Forking Workflow" as described in the Atlassian Documentation here:
[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

I've started a documentation on how we should use the forking workflow here:

[https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/blob/documentation/doc/forking-workflow/index.md](https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/blob/documentation/doc/forking-workflow/index.md)
(will not be merged to main due to file sizes)

You can find a short documentation about updating your fork and clone [here](doc/git/update.md)

### Deploy your Fork on GH-Pages

You can easily deploy your fork on GH-Pages by following the instructions here:
[http://about-hugo.github.io/hugo/quick/](http://about-hugo.github.io/hugo/quick/)

The workflow is ".github/workflows/gh-pages-action.yml"

For a detailed Description of the Website Release process, see this page: [release-process.md](doc/release-process.md)

### Updating your Fork

You can find a documention in the following sub-page: [doc/git/update.md](doc/git/update.md)


## Including additional content
In addition to the required content you can add sub-pages. 

Please consider:
- the Urheberrecht for all material you provide: Include the information (source, creator etc.) in the caption
- please reduce the file sizes for all images and videos that are included in the site


### Content Guide

A comprehensive guide to using content blocks, images, galleries, videos and GitHub gists can be found [here](doc/project/content_guide.md).


## Site Administration

### Adding a new semester
This repository contains a utility script to transition the website to a new semester.
It changes the semester set in the config file (`current_semester` in `config/_default/config.toml`) and
scaffolds the folder structure for the projects of the new semester.
```shell
./new_semester.sh <semester>
```
Example: Transitioning to summer semester 2022
```shell
./new_semester.sh ss22
```

### Deployment Setup

#### Staging and Production Preview

Every push to main results in a deploy to 
- development: [https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/showtime-website/](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/showtime-website/) (with drafts)
- staging: [https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/) (without drafts)

<details>
<summary> Staging Deployment Details </summary>

Every push on main is deployed to the Github Page in the repo
https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/htw-imi-showtime.github.io

see the workflow definition in [.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml)

the secret ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY in
https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/settings/secrets/actions

is defined in
https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/htw-imi-showtime.github.io/settings/keys
</details>

#### Production

For production, each github release is build and scp'ed to showtime.f4.htw-berlin.de

see the workflow definition in [.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml)

for the scp, the rsa key credentials must be set correctly in the [Repo's Secrets](https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/settings/secrets/actions) - generate new ones with root access on the server if lost.

#### Create a new Release:

- Tag the according commit and push the tag:
    git tag 2021.1.2
    git push <tag>

with 2021.1 for the first semester in 2021 (summer) and .2 for the second version.


- [Create a new release on GitHub](https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/releases)
