## Adding a new project
If you want to add your project to the website, please follow these steps and create a pull request when you're done:
1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the project:
```
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your-account>/showtime-website.git
cd showtime-website
```
or using SSH:
```
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your-account>/showtime-website.git
cd showtime-website
```

3. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) from https://gohugo.io \
   You can check your installation by executing `hugo server` and visiting
   http://localhost:1313/ in your browser.
   If you get an error - did you forget to clone the submodules? If so, you can get the theme submodule by running
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
4. Create a new project directory for your project by duplicating either the bachelor's or the master's sample project directory:
```
cp -R content/ws21/bachelor/b0-template-project/ content/ws21/bachelor/b#-your-project/
```
```
cp -R content/ws21/master/m0-template-project/ content/ws21/master/m#-your-project/
```
**Please make sure to include your project number! (e.g. B2, M1, ...)**

5. Fill out your project's homepage `content/ws21/<bachelor/master>/##-your-project/_index.md` and any subpages in your project's directory you'd like to keep. Delete the subpages you don't need.\
   **Please don't use headings (hashtags) directly, since regular headings won't be displayed correctly.**\
   If you need help with the markdown syntax, have a look at this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).\
   You may also create subpages (`page-name.md`) and put images or videos in your project's directory (**less than 100 MB per file**, please upload videos to the HTW Mediathek and [embed them](#HTW-Mediathek-Player)).
   For an example on how to include videos, images, quotes and GitHub gists, please have a look at the documentation below or the examples included in the template projects.
6. Preview your changes locally to make sure everything looks fine by executing `hugo server` and visiting http://localhost:1313/ in your browser.
7. Add your changes to the index, commit them to the repository and push them to GitHub:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
8. Create a new pull request on GitHub that merges your version of the repo's `master` branch onto the htw-imi-showtime `master` branch. ([GitHub Help: Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork))

Once your branch was merged, you may view your project's page on https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/

## Updating your Fork

To get the updates on the central repository into your fork, do the following:
(see [Github on Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)
)
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

To update the theme submodule, run

```
git submodule update
```

## Including additional content
In addition to the required content you can add any content you want - at least this term (winter semester 2021) this site
replaces the Showtime Fair with the booths and posters. Please consider
- the Urheberrecht for all material you provide: Include the information (source, creator etc.) in the caption
- please reduce the file sizes for all images and videos that are included in the site

**Please do not add new subpages or change the names of the included subpages. We want all the projects to have a similar structure, so the website is more consistent for visitors.**

### Images
Note that the description parameter is optional and may be left out for disabling the caption.
```handlebars
{{<image src="filename.type" alt="Alt text for image" description="The image's caption">}}
```
Example: Including `image.png` with "Alt text" as alt text and "Is displayed below the image" as description.
```handlebars
{{<image src="image.png" alt="Alt text" description="Is displayed below the image">}}
```
Example: Including `image.png` with "Alt text" as alt text and no description:
```handlebars
{{<image src="image.png" alt="Alt text">}}
```

### Videos
Please upload your videos to the HTW Mediathek and embed them using the [Mediathek Player](#HTW-Mediathek-Player). Please DO NOT embed YouTube-Videos into your project pages (The YouTube video player doesn't conform to/is not covered in our privacy policy).

### HTW Mediathek Player
Note that the title parameter is optional and may be left out for only displaying the player without a heading.
```handlebars
{{<mediathek id="video_id" title="Our project demo">}}
```
Example: Embedding https://mediathek.htw-berlin.de/video/Clean-Code-Presentation-on-Comment/117e5ae717b582bdeac13d95e8fa2264
```handlebars
{{<mediathek id="117e5ae717b582bdeac13d95e8fa2264" title="Our project demo">}}
```

### GitHub Gists
```handlebars
{{<gist "username" "gist_id">}}
```
Example: Embedding https://gist.github.com/Kaes3kuch3n/643befb000375fea7c5f675fb180cfbd
```handlebars
{{<gist "Kaes3kuch3n" "643befb000375fea7c5f675fb180cfbd">}}
```
