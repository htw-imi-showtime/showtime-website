# Generic Workflow that builds the hugo page from . (root dir of the repo)
# sets the baseURL for hugo to 'https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>'
# publishes the hugo page using the (older) option by pushing the 
# page to the branch gh-pages

# use it with <repo>->Settings->Pages "Deploy from a branch"
# Select Branch: "gh-pages" Select Folder: "/(root)"
# Contains a RUN_IF to prevent it from running in the original repo

# This is here for legacy reasons. If in doubt, use the workflow in gh-pages-action.yml !
