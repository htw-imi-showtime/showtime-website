### Opening a Pull Request to Update your Project

Please follow these Steps & Guidelines for your Pull Request:

#### Before you Request a Review Check and Tick these Boxes:

[] make sure that the hugo site build works and check the result visually.
[] merge your local branch with upstream/main (see [update doc](https://github.com/htw-imi-showtime/showtime-website/blob/main/doc/update.md)) 
[] Deploy the Site on your github pages by activating the "Deploy Page using GH-Actions" Workflow in "gh-pages-action.yml"
[] make sure that your PR contains only files / file changes within your project subdirectory. 
[] make sure that all your file names consist only of lower case letters, numbers, or [-_.] - with only one . for the file extension
[] delete all unnecessary files from your PR (including cat.jpg and kitty.jpg)
[] check the image file sizes. All Images have to be as small as possible. See [./doc/disk_usage.md](./doc/disk_usage.md) about this issues, there's a script: [./bin/images-smaller.sh](./bin/images-smaller.sh)

**Note that if you fail to do so, I may simply reduce the file sizes brute force using 
the script above - WITHOUT CHECKING THE QUALITY**

[] if everythings seems fine, request a review by bkleinen on github. (on the upper right)

1. Change the PR Title to: <project-id> <describe your changes> (e.g. B0 - update techstack.md) and describe your changes:
